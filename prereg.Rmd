## Hintergrund

Stereotype threat, introduced by @steeleStereotypeThreatIntellectual1995, describes the situational predicament where members of a historically marginalized social group, aware of negative stereotypes surrounding their in-group, feel at risk of confirming these stereotypes [@appelStereotypesAchievementGap2012; @beilockStereotypeThreatWorking2007; @jonczykHowStereotypeThreat2022a; @spencerStereotypeThreatWomen1999; @steeleStereotypeThreatIntellectual1995; @steeleThreatAirHow1997; @wheelerEffectsStereotypeActivation2001]. Attempts to avoid this outcome can lead to suboptimal performance [@schmaderIntegratedProcessModel2008; @spencerStereotypeThreat2016].

@schmaderConvergingEvidenceThat2003 propose that stereotype threat impairs working memory capacity, hindering performance on complex cognitive tasks. This impairment is attributed to the cognitive load imposed by anxiety and self-monitoring under stereotype threat. Research demonstrates that stereotype threat reduces the efficiency of working memory systems, particularly the phonological loop and central executive functions [@beilockStereotypeThreatWorking2007]. Further, @ashcraftRelationshipsWorkingMemory2001 proposed that anxiety about task performance under stereotype threat drains working memory resources by inducing intrusive thoughts and worries that compete with ongoing cognitive tasks.

Stereotype threat has been most extensively studied in academic settings, the primary focus of this literature review.
Research into the mechanisms of stereotype threat has primarily utilized more economical methods (e.g., questionnaires, behavioural observations) [@derksNeuroscienceStigmaStereotype2008a], with a smaller body of work employing the tools of social neuroscience, a relatively nascent field.

Social neuroscience integrates social psychology and cognitive neuroscience, offering the possibility to gain more profound insight into the cognitive processes and neural mechanisms underlying stereotype threat [@derksNeuroscienceStigmaStereotype2008a]. Tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) allow researchers to explore specific neural regions and systems in social psychology phenomena [@ochsnerEmergenceSocialCognitive2001].

Neuroimaging studies have revealed that stereotype threat can induce variations in neural activation across different brain areas and networks [e.g. @jonczykHowStereotypeThreat2022a; @krendlNegativeConsequencesThreat2008; @wragaNeuralBasisStereotypeinduced2007a].

Drawing from these theories and empirical findings, this literature review aims to address the following research questions: 
- How does stereotype threat impact neural activation patterns and cognitive processes in academic settings? 
- What are the specific neural and cognitive mechanisms through which stereotype threat influences academic performance? 


By employing social neuroscience techniques, this review seeks to elucidate how stereotype threat influences brain function and cognitive processes, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of its impact in the academic context. To do so, this literature review will include studies that have employed neuroimaging techniques as well as those that have used behavioural measures to investigate the effects of stereotype threat on cognitive processes and academic performance — as far as it is related to the below hypotheses.
The academic context is defined as any situation where individuals are engaged in learning, teaching, or research activities within an educational institution. This includes, but is not limited to classroom instruction, laboratory work, collaborative projects, and assessments such as tests and exams, where performance and evaluation are integral components.





## Hypothesen:

**H1:** In academic context, stereotype threat induces variations in neural activation across different brain areas and networks, potentially influcencing academic performance. These may include, but are not limited to, the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, the default mode network, and the salience network.

**H2**: Individuals under stereotype threat will experience a temporary delice in cognitive control (as measured through brain activation patterns in the cognitive control network, executive function network, or through performance on behavioural tasks and questionnaires). This decline will lead to poorer academic performance compared to individuals not experiencing stereotype threat.

**H3**: Students working memory performance is impaired under conditions of stereotype threat in academic settings. This impairment manifests through a reduction in working memory capacity, processing speed and accuracy.

ResearchRabbit will be utilized to discover additional research based on the Zotero library collection, including similar reserach, research by the same authors, earlier and later work, linked content, and suggested authors.
