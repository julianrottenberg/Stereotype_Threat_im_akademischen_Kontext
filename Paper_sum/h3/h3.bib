  abstract = {Stereotype threat affects performance in many different groups across many different domains. Despite a large body of experimental research on situational stereotype threat, little attention has been paid to the consequences of repeated experience of stereotype threat. Using structural equation modeling on data from a representative sample of girls from secondary schools, the current research examined the relations of chronic stereotype threat with mathematical achievement, and effectiveness of working memory functions. Moving beyond past theory, this study examined a new mechanism by which chronic stereotype threat decreases school achievement - namely intellectual helplessness. We assumed that repeated experience of stereotype threat works as intellectual helplessness training. After the phase of cognitive mobilization, cognitive exhaustion appears, because the individual has no gain from intense cognitive effort. Corroborating previous research on acute stereotype threat, we demonstrated that chronic stereotype threat is negatively associated with mathematical achievement. Additionally, it was also associated with lower effectiveness of working memory functions, which seems to show depletion of working memory as an effect of chronic stereotype threat. The results also demonstrated that both mediational paths from chronic stereotype threat to mathematical achievement: through working memory depletion and through intellectual helplessness were significant but only for girls that were highly identified with their gender group. In sum, we extended a well-established model of acute stereotype threat to its chronic version and suggested a new mechanism of chronic stereotype threat, which involves intellectual helplessness. Implications for stereotype threat theory and educational practice are discussed.},

We hypothesized that stereotype threat may lead to higher intellectual helplessness, lower working memory capacity, lower achievement, and domain identification but only in young men highly identified with their gender group. To test these assumptions we used self-descriptive measures of stereotype threat, intellectual helplessness, gender identification, and domain identification. We also evaluated working memory capacity by working memory test and school achievement using grade point average. Our predictions were tested in structural equation modeling on a nationwide sample of 319 young men from coeducational schools, aged 14--16 years. The results revealed that working memory was a mediator of achievement (               {$\gamma$}               \,=\,0.45, 95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,[0.34, 0.55]), while intellectual helplessness was related to both domain identification (               {$\gamma$}               \,=\,-0.13, 95\% CI\,=\,[-0.22, -0.04]) and achievement (               {$\gamma$}               \,=\,-0.13, 95\% CI\,=\,[-0.21, -0.06]). The proposed model extends our previous work on the role of intellectual helplessness in mathematics by testing the same intervening variable in a different domain, that is, in language arts. We discuss these results in light of previous research on stereotype threat and present practical implications.},

While this intervening task is often a working memory measure, an indirect index of mind-wandering, the sustained attention to response task (SART), has also been used to argue that mind-wandering contributes to the working memory deficit. We tested the direct effect of stereotype threat on mind-wandering by describing the SART as either related to the gender-math stereotype or an unrelated attention task, while also manipulating stereotype threat for an anticipated GRE math test. We found that SART-stereotype threat participants outperformed participants who were told that the SART was an unrelated task, regardless of the stereotype threat condition to which they were assigned for the anticipated math test. These findings show that the assumption that performance on the intervening, unrelated task is debilitated by a working memory deficit is unwarranted and are, instead, consistent with the mere effort account.

  abstract = {The high prevalence of childhood obesity has drawn increasing attention to the neurocognitive impairments associated with excess weight, and evidence has accumulated of a progressive decline in working memory at increasing levels of children's Body Mass Index (BMI). However, obesity is also a highly stigmatizing condition, and pervasive societal stereotypes depict individuals with obesity as less intelligent than those with average weight. For this reason, we investigated whether stereotype threat (i.e., the fear of confirming a negative stereotype attached to one's social groups) contributes to working memory impairments in children with excess weight. By applying a consolidated paradigm in stereotype threat research, primary school-age children (N=176) performed a computerized working memory task that was alternatively labeled as diagnostic (i.e., stereotype-threatening) or nondiagnostic (i.e., non-stereotype-threatening) of their intellectual ability. Results confirmed that working memory decreased at increasing levels of BMI in the stereotype-threatening condition, whereas the relation between body weight and working memory was null when task diagnosticity was removed. This effect was not further moderated by children's direct experiences of weight-based stigmatization or by their personal endorsement of the obesity stereotype about intelligence. These findings suggest that vulnerability to weight-related stereotype threat emerges early in life and may contribute to working memory deficits in children with obesity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One hundred eighty-seven Montana State University (MSU) men were first given the Operation Span task (OSPAN) to assess working memory capacity, then engaged in the Stroop task under mostly incongruent or mostly congruent conditions. The Stroop task was presented as a measure of verbal processing skills (stereotype threat condition) or not (control condition). Stroop errors and reaction times were assessed.

Problematically, the mere effort account indexes performance motivation as task performance. Also, this account posits that performance reduction on non-prepotent tasks derives from the overproduction of prepotent responses, as opposed to failed inhibition of prepotent responses associated with the alternative, namely, the working memory interference perspective. We investigated motivational and prepotent responding as applied to stereotype threat. In Experiment 1, a maths question selection task indexed motivation (independently of performance). Stereotype threat led female test takers to select more solve than comparison maths questions, in accord with the mere effort account. In Experiment 2, higher inhibitory ability protected overall maths performance following stereotype threat, but it did not protect non-prepotentiated comparison question performance (inconsistent with the working memory interference perspective).

The antisaccade task provides a vehicle to test this account because optimal performance requires working memory resources to inhibit the tendency to look at an irrelevant, peripheral cue (the prepotent response) and to generate volitional saccades to the target. If stereotype threat occupies working memory resources, then the ability to inhibit the prepotent response and to launch volitional saccades will be impaired, and performance will suffer. In contrast, S. Harkins's (2006) mere effort account argues that stereotype threat participants are motivated to perform well, which potentiates the prepotent response, but also leads to efforts to counter this tendency if participants recognize that the response is incorrect, know the correct response, and have the opportunity to make it.

Moving beyond past work, it was also demonstrated that concomitantly presenting a positive self-relevant stereotype (e.g., college students are good at math) increased the relative accessibility of females' college student identity and inhibited their gender identity, eliminating attendant working memory deficits and contingent math performance decrements. Furthermore, subtle manipulations in questions presented in the demographic section of a math test eliminated stereotype threat effects that result from women reporting their gender before completing the test. This work identifies the motivated processes through which people's social identities became active in situations in which self-relevant stereotypes about a stigmatized group membership and a nonstigmatized group membership were available.

  abstract = {Three studies tested the hypothesis that negative metacognitive interpretations of anxious arousal under stereotype threat create cognitive deficits in intellectually threatening environments. Study 1 showed that among minority and White undergraduates, anxiety about an intelligence test predicted lower working memory when participants were primed with doubt as compared to confidence. Study 2 replicated this pattern with women and showed it to be unique to intellectually threatening environments. Study 3 used emotional reappraisal as an individual difference measure of the tendency to metacognitively reinterpret negative emotions and found that when sympathetic activation was high (indexed by salivary alpha-amylase), women who tended to reappraise negative feelings performed better in math and felt less self-doubt than those low in reappraisal. Overall, findings highlight how metacognitive interpretations of affect can undermine cognitive efficiency under stereotype threat and offer implications for the situational and individual difference variables that buffer people from these effects.},

  abstract = {The currently prevailing explanation for stereotype threat (ST) debilitation effects argues for working memory interference as the proximal mediator. Using mental arithmetic problems as the test bed, Beilock et al. (2007) have spelled out in greater detail exactly how this process might work. They propose that worries resulting from activation of the negative stereotype occupy the phonological loop, taking up capacity that could be used to remember the intermediate values produced when solving horizontal mental subtraction problems. In the current work, we test an alternative, motivational account for this effect, mere effort. The mere effort account argues that ST motivates stigmatized participants to want to perform well, potentiating the prepotent response on the given task. In Experiment 1 we identified a possible prepotent response for horizontal subtraction, termed the method of adjustment (e.g., adjust the second number to the nearest 10, subtract the two numbers, and then add the adjustment). Consistent with the mere effort account, Experiment 2 showed that ST potentiated the prepotent approach, the method of adjustment. Experiment 3 pitted the mere effort account against the working memory account. Working memory predicts debilitation effects on horizontal subtraction problems when participants need to use the phonological loop (i.e., entering answers from left-to-right), whereas mere effort predicts that the potentiated use of the method of adjustment should facilitate performance when answers must be entered from left-to-right. Results supported the mere effort account. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that when we control for the effect of the potentiated prepotent response, instead of performing more poorly, threatened participants perform better than no threat participants. Overall, these experiments support the mere effort account, which argues for motivation as a core process in producing ST effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This study compared the relative impact of gender-, race-, and income-based stereotype threat and examined if individuals with multiple stigmatized aspects of identity experience a larger stereotype threat effect on math performance and working memory function than people with one stigmatized aspect of identity. Seventy-one college students of the stigmatized and privileged gender, race, and income-level completed math and working memory pre-tests. Then, participants heard a moderately explicit stereotype threat-inducing prime. Next, participants took math and working memory post-tests. Stereotype threat effects were found on math performance on the basis of race and income-level, but not on the basis of gender. Stereotype threat effects were found on working memory function on the basis of gender, race, and income-level. For both measures, the income-based effects were the strongest. Results also suggest the possibility of multiple minority stereotype threat effects on math performance and working memory. More specifically, individuals with three stigmatized aspects of identity experienced significantly larger stereotype threat effects than those with zero-, one-, or two-stigmatized aspects of identity.},

  abstract = {This research examined whether feeling powerful can eliminate the deleterious effect of stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about confirming a negative self-relevant stereotype) on women's math performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, priming women with high power buffered them from reduced math performance in response to stereotype threat instructions, whereas women in the low and control power conditions showed poorer math performance in response to threat. Experiment 3 found that working memory capacity is one mechanism through which power moderates the effect of threat on women's math performance. In the low and control power conditions, women showed reduced working memory capacity in response to stereotype threat, accounting for threat's effect on performance. In contrast, women in the high power condition did not show reductions in working memory capacity or math performance in response to threat. This work demonstrates that perceived power moderates stereotype threat--based performance effects and explains why this occurs.},
