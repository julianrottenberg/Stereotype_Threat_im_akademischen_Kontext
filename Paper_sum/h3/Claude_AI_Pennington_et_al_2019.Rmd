### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)  

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was explicitly linked to existing research on stereotype threat effects on women's mathematical performance. It aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying stereotype threat effects by testing the mere effort account against the working memory interference account.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The authors do not report how the study was funded.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on stereotype threat effects on women's mathematical and visuospatial performance, specifically examining the underlying mechanisms of mere effort vs. working memory interference.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is female university students.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 21 and over  

The mean age of participants was 21 years old.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Female only  

The study focused only on female participants.

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

Participants were recruited from a university in the United Kingdom.

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United Kingdom.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examined the effects of stereotype threat on women's performance on an anti-saccade eye-tracking task and a modular arithmetic task. It compared negative and positive stereotype priming conditions to a control condition to test mechanisms of mere effort vs. working memory interference.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study aimed to test two competing hypotheses:

1. The mere effort account predicts that stereotype threat will lead to faster correct saccades and more corrective saccades on the anti-saccade task.

2. The working memory interference account predicts that stereotype threat will lead to slower correct saccades and fewer corrective saccades.

For the math task, it was hypothesized that negative stereotypes would impair performance, especially on difficult problems, while positive stereotypes may facilitate performance on simple problems but impair performance on difficult problems.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measured:
- Performance on an anti-saccade eye-tracking task (accuracy, saccadic reaction time)
- Performance on a modular arithmetic task (accuracy)
- Endorsement of gender stereotypes (manipulation checks)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study used a cross-sectional design, measuring outcomes at a single time point.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Measurements were taken only after the stereotype threat manipulations.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: negative stereotype, positive stereotype, or control.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in the stereotype threat prime they received:
- Negative stereotype group: primed with negative stereotypes about women's math ability
- Positive stereotype group: primed with positive stereotypes about women's math ability  
- Control group: no stereotype priming

### Number of groups

- [x] Three  

There were three experimental groups.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to the three conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not specify if allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

All groups completed the same tasks, with only the stereotype prime differing between conditions.

### Study design summary 

This was a randomized experimental study with three between-subjects conditions (negative stereotype, positive stereotype, control). Participants completed an anti-saccade eye-tracking task and modular arithmetic task after receiving their assigned stereotype prime. The study used a cross-sectional design, measuring outcomes at a single time point after the manipulation.

The authors justify their methods based on previous research and the need to test competing theoretical accounts.

### Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The experimental design with random assignment to conditions was appropriate for testing causal effects of stereotype threat.

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A lot (please specify)

The random assignment and use of manipulation checks help rule out alternative explanations. The Bayesian analyses also quantify evidence for null vs. alternative hypotheses.

### How generalisable are the study results?

- [x] Details

The results may have limited generalizability due to the specific sample (primarily White British female university students) and the laboratory setting. However, the findings contribute to the broader literature on stereotype threat mechanisms.

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)

The study can be considered of medium trustworthiness. The experimental design, random assignment, and use of established tasks strengthen its validity. However, the limited sample diversity and lack of detail on recruitment methods slightly reduce its overall trustworthiness.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [x] High trustworthiness

The authors provide a balanced interpretation of their findings, considering both their results and the broader literature. They use Bayesian analyses to quantify evidence for null hypotheses and discuss potential limitations and implications.
