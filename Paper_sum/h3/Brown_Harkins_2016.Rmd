### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [ ] Explicitly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  


### Study timing
*Please indicate all that apply and give further details where possible.*

*If the study examines one or more samples, but each at only one point in time it is cross-sectional.*  
*If the study examines the same samples, but as they have changed over time, it is retrospective, provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking backwards over time.*  
*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [ ] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  


## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  
- [ ] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### How do the groups differ?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] Explicityly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)

- [ ] Random  
- [ ] Quasi-random  
- [ ] Non-random  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

- [ ] Not applicable (no prospective allocation)  
- [ ] Yes (please specify)
