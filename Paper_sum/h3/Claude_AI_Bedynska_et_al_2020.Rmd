### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

The key findings relevant to H3 include:
- Working memory mediated the relationship between stereotype threat and language achievement ($\gamma$ = 0.45, 95% CI [0.34, 0.55])
- Intellectual helplessness mediated the relationships between stereotype threat and both achievement ($\gamma$ = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.21, -0.06]) and domain identification ($\gamma$ = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.04])
- These effects were only significant for boys with high gender identification

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
