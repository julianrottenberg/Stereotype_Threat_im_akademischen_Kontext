- We predicted that when receiving stereotype threat, women in the high power condition would be protected from working memory decrements and impaired maths performance
- In contrast, we predicted that women in the control and low power conditions would show less working memory capacity and poorer maths performance when given stereotype threat instructions than when given the no threat instructions
- Moreover, we predicted that these differences in working memory capacity as a function of power and stereotype threat would account for maths performance differences
- Such results would suggest that differences in working memory capacity explain how feeling powerful eliminates the impact of stereotype threat information on women's maths performance seen in our first two experiments.

### Study timing
*Please indicate all that apply and give further details where possible.*

*If the study examines one or more samples, but each at only one point in time it is cross-sectional.*  
*If the study examines the same samples, but as they have changed over time, it is retrospective, provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking backwards over time.*  
*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?
*If at least one of the outcome variables is measured both before and after the intervention, please use the before and after category.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not an evaluation)  
- [ ] Before and after  
- [ ] Only after  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  


## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  
- [ ] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### How do the groups differ?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

- 3 (power: low, control, high) x 2 (stereotype threat instructions: no threat, stereotype threat) between-subjects factorial design  

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One  
- [ ] Two  
- [ ] Three  
- [x] Four or more (please specify)  
- [ ] Other/unclear (please specify)  

- six  

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] Not applicate (no prospective allocation)  
- [x] Random  
- [ ] Quasi-random  
- [ ] Non-random  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)

### Which statistical methods, if any, were used in the analysis?

- [ ] Details

*Content analysis*:
- Essays were content analysed to further ensure that the power manipulation was effective
- Two coders unaware of the hypotehses and to the experimental conditions rated each essay on how much power the participant expressed in her essay on a scale from -2 (low power) to 2 (high power)

**Manipulation check**:  
*Power self-report*:
- average of the four perceptions of power items was entered into a 3 (power) x 2 (stereotype threat instructions) ANOVA  
- post hoc tests   
*Content Analysis*:
- 3 (power) x 2 (stereotype threat) ANOVA on the power index  

**Mood**:
- mood scores, subtracted the composite of the 10 negative affect items from the composite of the 10 positive affect items, with higher scores indicating more positive mood.  

**Working memory**:
- effect of power and stereotype threat on participants' working memory capacity was examined  

**Maths performance**:
- Examined with a 3 (power) x 2 (stereotype threat) ANOVA  
- also analysed the effect of power and stereotype threat on maths reaction time  

**TBC**: 
- effect of power and stereotype threat on participants' TBC scores  

**Mediational analyses**:
- to examine whether working memory capacity mediated the effect of power and stereotype threat on women's maths performance, we conducted a series of multiple regression analyses
- First, we entered power, ST instructions, and the interaction term (multiplicative function) into a regression predicting maths performance
- Second regression predicted working memory capacity (i.e., the mediator variable)
- third regression, working memory capacity and maths performance
- fourth regression, simultaneously regressed maths performance on power, stereotype threat, the interaction term, and working memory capacity.
- Sobel test
- To more fully understand the mediation of working memory capacity for the relation of the interaction of power and stereotype threat and math performance, we examined whether the relation between stereotype threat and math performance could be accounted for by working memory capacity in each of the power conditions.

- [ ] Details

**Manipulation Check**:  
*Power Self=Report*:  
- significant main effect of power
- Post hoc tests indicated that women in the lower power conditions reported feeling significantly lower in power than those in the high power conditions, and those in the control power conditions
- Significant main effect of ST with women in the ST condition reporting feeling more powerful than women in the no ST condition
- We did not expect a main effect of ST on feelings of power; however, this main effect is difficult to interpret as the power manipulation check was completed *before* the manipulation of stereotype threat
- Interaction of stereotype threat and power was not significant.  
*Content Analysis*:
- ANOVA found only a significant main effect of power
- Essays of women in the high power condition were rated as reporting significantly more high power than women in both the lower power and the control power conditions
- Women in low power and control power conditions were also rated as significantly different from one another, with women in the low power condition expressing less power in their essays than women in the control power condition
- Neither a main effect of threat, nor the interaction of threat and power were significant. 

**Mood**:
- Mood measure showed a main effect of stereotype threat
- This main effect is difficult to interpret as the measure of mood was completed *before* the manipulation of stereotype threat
- No significant main effect of power or interaction of power and threat.  

**Working Memory**:
- Significant main effect of ST and a significant main effect of power
- the main effects were qualified by the predicted two-way interaction
- Women in low power and control conditions had lower WM scores when exposed to ST than when exposed to the no-ST instructions
- Women in the high power condition did not show difference in accuracy on the WM task when exposed to ST than when exposed to no ST  

**Maths performance**:
- Found a significant main effect of ST and a significant main effect of power
- Main effects were qualified by the predicted two-way interaction
- Women in low power and control power conditions had lower scores on the maths task when exposed to ST than when not exposed to ST
- Women in the high power condition showed a much smaller (hence the two-way interaction), marginally significant decline in accuracy when exposed to ST.
- Effect of power on ST on maths reaction time, neither of the main effects was statistically significant
- Two-way interaction was far from significant, indicating that the accuracy results were not due to a speed-accuracy trade-off  

**TBC**:
- only the main effect of ST was obtained
- Women in the ST conditions showed greater TBC than women in the no ST conditions.  

**Mediational Analyses**:
- First, consistent with the ANOVA results, the interaction of power and ST provided a unique contribution in predicting maths performance
- Second, consistent with the ANOVA results, the interaction term made a unique contribution when both the main effects of power and stereotype threat were entered in the model
- Third, showed that WM capacity was positively and significantly related to maths performance
- Fourth, showed that when accuracy on the WM task was included, the relation between the interaction term and maths performance was reduced to marginal significance
- Sobel test demonstrated that WM capacity accounted for a significant amount of variance in the relation between maths performance and the interaction of power and ST
- In the power condition, the relation between ST and maths performance, while still significant, was reduced when WM capacity was included in the model
- Sobel test showed that this reduction was significant
- In the control condition, the relation between ST and maths performance was no longer significant when WM capacity was included in the model
- In the high power condition, the relation between ST and maths performance was essentially unaltered when WM capacity was included in the model 
- Results indicate that WM capacity accounted for a significant amount of variance in the relation between ST and maths performance in the low and control power conditions.
- WM capacity served to mediate the relation between maths performance and ST in the low power and control condition but not in the high power condition
- Feeling powerful seemed to alleviate the impact of ST on WOM capacity, in turn reducing the impact of ST on maths performance.

We replicated our previous finding son maths performance decrements when exposed to ST information for women feeling low in power or in the control power condition, but again did not find a significant impairment on maths performance when women were exposed to threatening information and were feeling powerful.
We found that, when exposed to ST instructions, women in the high power condition did not show reduced WM capacity (relative to the no threat condition), whereas those in the lower power and control power conditions did show reduced WM capacity.
These differences in WM capacity statistically accounted for the interaction of ST and power on maths performance. 
These effect cannot be accounted for by mood.  
We also replicated the main effect of stereotype threat on TBC, such that all women exposed to stereotype threat instructions reported greater levels of worry regarding confirming the negative stereotype than women who were exposed to the no threat instructions. The results from Experiment 3 provide evidence that the protective influence high power has on working memory capacity is one of the processes underlying the elimination of math performance effects found for women in this condition in Experiments 1 and 2.
