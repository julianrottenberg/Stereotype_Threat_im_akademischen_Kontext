### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)  

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by existing research on stereotype threat, which shows that awareness of negative stereotypes about one's group can lead to reduced performance. It was also linked to research on power and its effects on cognitive resources.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The research was funded in part by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship to the first author.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on how feelings of power can protect women from the negative effects of stereotype threat on math performance, and examines working memory capacity as a potential mechanism.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is undergraduate women.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 17 - 20  

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Female only  

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how feelings of power interact with stereotype threat to affect women's math performance and working memory capacity. It investigates whether feeling powerful can protect women from the negative effects of stereotype threat on math performance by preserving working memory capacity.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The authors hypothesized that women made to feel powerful would be protected from working memory decrements in response to stereotype threat, and thus would not show strong stereotype threat-based performance effects. In contrast, women in low power and control conditions were expected to show decreased math performance when given stereotype threat instructions, accounted for by reductions in working memory capacity.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measures power (manipulated as high, low, or control), stereotype threat (threat or no threat instructions), working memory capacity, math performance, and threat-based concern.

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Measurements of working memory capacity and math performance were made after the power manipulation and stereotype threat instructions.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to power conditions (high, low, control) and stereotype threat conditions (threat, no threat).

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differ in their assigned power condition (high, low, or control) and whether they received stereotype threat or no threat instructions.

### Number of groups

- [x] Six  

There were six groups: high power-threat, high power-no threat, low power-threat, low power-no threat, control power-threat, and control power-no threat.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state whether allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

### Study design summary 

This was a 3 (power: low, control, high) x 2 (stereotype threat instructions: no threat, stereotype threat) between-subjects experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions. The study measured working memory capacity and math performance after manipulations of power and stereotype threat.
