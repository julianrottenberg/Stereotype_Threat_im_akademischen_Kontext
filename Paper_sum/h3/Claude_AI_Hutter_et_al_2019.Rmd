## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [X] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by previous research on stereotype threat effects, particularly the mere effort account and working memory interference perspective. It references work by Steele & Aronson (1995), Jamieson & Harkins (2007, 2009), Schmader et al. (2008), and others.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

The paper does not mention any funding sources.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on stereotype threat effects on women's math performance, examining the motivational and prepotent response mechanisms proposed by the mere effort account versus the working memory interference perspective.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is female undergraduate students.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [X] 17 - 20  
- [X] 21 and over  

The participants were female undergraduates aged 18-25 years (M=20.50, SD=1.61).

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [X] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the UK.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines stereotype threat effects on women's math performance, comparing the mere effort account (focusing on motivation and prepotent responses) to the working memory interference perspective. It investigates how stereotype threat affects performance on different types of math questions (solve vs. comparison) and the role of inhibitory ability.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [X] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study hypothesized that:
1) Stereotype threat would lead to performance boost for solve questions and performance decrement for comparison questions.
2) Higher inhibitory ability would protect overall math performance following stereotype threat, but would not protect non-prepotentiated comparison question performance.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [X] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measured:
- Math performance (overall and by question type)
- Inhibitory ability (using a Stroop task)
- Indirect math motivation
- Gender identification
- Math identification

### Study timing

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [X] Only after  

Measurements were taken after the stereotype threat manipulation and math test.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [X] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to stereotype threat or no-stereotype threat conditions, and to solve or comparison question types.

### How do the groups differ?

- [X] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed based on:
1) Stereotype threat condition (stereotype threat vs. no-stereotype threat)
2) Math question type (solve vs. comparison)

### Number of groups

- [X] Four or more (please specify)  

There were 4 groups: 2 (stereotype threat condition) x 2 (question type)

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [X] Random  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [X] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state if allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [X] Yes

All groups completed the same procedures aside from the experimental manipulations.

### Study design summary 

This was a 2 (condition: stereotype threat, no-stereotype threat) Ã— 2 (question type: solve, comparison) between-subjects experimental design with inhibitory ability as a continuous moderator variable. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions and completed a Stroop task, math test, and post-test measures.
