\item
  Participants in the GRE-stereotype threat/SART unrelated condition will perform more poorly than GRE-no stereotype threat/SART-unrelated participants, replicating Mrazek et al.'s (2011) findings.
\item
  In the SART-stereotype threat conditions, the difference in performance between GRE-stereotype and GRE-no stereotype threat participants should be eliminated, replicating Jamieson and Harkins (2011). That is, when performance on the SART is related to gender-maths stereotype, the participants in these two conditions should be equally and highly motivated to perform well on the SART, whether or not they anticipate taking the maths test under stereotype threat.

  Participants in the SART-stereotype threat conditions should outperform in the SART-unrelated conditions whether they are assigned to the GRE-no stereotype threat condition

Either would introduce bias.}

\subsubsection{Study design summary}\label{study-design-summary}

\emph{In addition to answering the questions in this section, describe the study design in your own words. You may want to draw upon and elaborate the answers you have already given.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Greeted and told about math test
\item
  Stereotype threat manipulation vs no manipulation
\item
  3 sample GRE problems (GRE stereotype threat vs GRE no stereotype threat)
\item
  SART manipulation (SART stereotype threat vs SART no stereotype threat)
\item
  SART task
\item
  two manipulation checks (one for SART and one for the math task, the math task were supposedly the GRE problems, which were never performed)
\item
  Experiment concluded after the two manipulation checks and no math task was given.
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that the description of the ``procedure'' is very ambiguous.
It is said that in the Mrazek replication conditions, half of the participants were told that the SART is unrelated and the other half was told that the SART showed gender differences. This implies that they are still referring to the other half of the Mrazek replication conditions. But then we'd be left with the participants in ``no replication conditions'' and without any information about what they did or what they were told.\\
Thus the study only described the procedure for half of the participants.

However, it can also be implied (but then it is written in a very misleading way) that ``half of the participants'' refers to the total sample size. In this case the study design would be as described above, and a 2 x 2 design would be used. However, by the authors description it is not clear which of the two interpretations is correct. I just assume that it is the latter one since otherwise, the study does not make any sense.

\textbf{Manipulation checks}:
\emph{SART manipulation check}:
- SART stereotype threat participants believed that this task was related to math ability to a greater extent than SART unrelated participants.
- SART-stereotype threat participants also reported that gender differences existed on the SART to a greater extent than SART-unrelated participants.
- SART-stereotype threat participants reported that men performed better than women on the SART to a greater extent than SART-unrelated participants.
- The effect of anticipated threat and the interaction did not approach significance in any analysis.
\emph{Math test manipulation}:
- Participants did not differ in their ratings of the extent to which performance on the anticipated math test reflected math ability
- GRE-stereotype threat participants reported that the math test would produce gender differences to a greater extent than GRE-no stereotype threat participants.
- GRE-stereotype threat participants also reported that men would outperform women on the upcoming math test to a greater extent than GRE-no stereotype threat participants.
- The effect of SART description and the interaction did not approach significance in any analysis.
- These results indicate that our manipulations were successful.

\textbf{SART performance}:
\emph{Statistical analysis of performance}:
- The four predictions from the mere effort account can be tested in a linear contrast that predicts that the performance of participants in the SART-stereotype threat condition will not differ as a function of whether they anticipated taking the math test under stereotype threat or not and will exhibit less mind-wandering than participants in the GRE-no stereotype threat/SART-unrelated condition:
- These three groups are also predicted to show less mind-wandering than participants in the GRE-stereotype threat/SART-unrelated condition
-\textgreater{} These weights were chosen to create three levels of performance (i.e., low, moderate, high), in line with the predictions depicted in Figure 1
- The working memory account predicts that participants given the stereotype threat manipulation for the anticipated math test, the SART, or both will exhibit equivalent amount of mind-wandering, all more than the mind-wandering found in the GRE-no stereotype threat/SART-unrelated condition.
- These weights map onto those depicted in Figure 1, such that the working memory account suggests that being assigned to a stereotype threat condition for either measure should lead to debilitated performance on the SART
\emph{Mere effort}:
- There was a significant overall effect for the mere effort contrast
- The univariate tests of these predictions also yielded significant effects supporting the mere effort account for commission errors, omissions, anticipations, RT coefficient of variation
- The proportion of variance in the \(SS_{between}\) that was explained by the contrast was calculated
- For commission errors, the contrast testing the mere account predictions accounted for 98.7\% of the variance between conditions.
- For omissions, the contrast accounted for 75.8\% of the variance
- The mere effort predictions accounted for 71.8\% of the variance for anticipations
- 99.2\% of the variance was captured by the contrast for RT coefficient variation
- The residuals of this contrast were also tested to determine whether any systematic variance remained for commission errors, omissions, anticipations, and RT coefficients of variation
- Means and SD for all four dependent variables are presented in Table 1
\emph{Working memory}:
- Experiencing stereotype threat for either the anticipated math test, the SART, or both, leads to equivalent performance, which is worse than that found in the GRE-no threat/SART-unrelated condition.
- The multivariate test of this prediction was not significant
- None of the univariate tests of this prediction were significant
- The proportion of variance accounted for by the contrast was also calculated for these predictions
- For commission errors, omissions, anticipations, and RT coefficient of variation, the contrast for the working memory deficit account predictions accounted for 0.4\%, 11.5\%, 14.5\%, and 6.4\% of the variance between groups, respectively
- The residuals of this contrast were also tested to determine whether any systematic variance remained for commission errors, omissions, anticipations, and RT coefficients of variation.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Details
\item
  We replicated Mrazek et al.'s (2011) general pattern of findings on the SART with only minor differences
\item
  However, we also found that across all four SART measures mere effort predicted substantially more variance than the working memory account
\item
  Furthermore, nonsignificant tests of the mere effort contrast residuals suggest that these predictions accounted for all of the systematic variance in the means for three of the four SART measures, including commissions errors, whereas the tests of the working memory contrast residuals suggested that the data do not conform the predictions drawn from that perspective.\\
\item
  This pattern of means suggests that when performance on the SART is introduced as unrelated to the manipulated stereotype, participants in the GRE-stereotype threat condition perform more poorly than their GRE-no stereotype threat counterparts.
\item
  Describing the SARt as related to the same stereotype that was manipulated for the math test eliminated this difference between these two conditions
\item
  Critically, in line with the suggestion that undergoing stereotype threat leads to increase motivation, participants in the SART-stereotype threat conditiosn also outperformed participants in each of the SART-unrelated conditions
\item
  More specifically, the present research supports the motivational, mere effort account for stereotype threat performance effects over the cognitive, working memory deficit account. Knowing what causes stereotype threat performance effects is important because this knowledge is required for us to design interventions to counter these effects.

  this one is hard. The explanations for the results sound interesting but there might be a bias by the authors, since they also conducted the other studies that link the mere effort account and stereotype threat. Moreover, the mere effort account is based on the analysis of one of the authors, thus it is possible that they try to ``defend'' this stance.\\
\item
  The explanations are also plausible and the papers that explain the performance issues under stereotype threat are also mostly by the same few researchers.
\item
  It is unclear if the additions to the replication (SART stereotype threat) did not favour the mere effort account.\\
\item
  Also i, personally, did not like the description of the study and its procedure at all, so i might be biased and more critical/negative than necessary.
