Three studies tested the hypothesis that negative metacognitive interpretations of anxious arousal under stereotype threat create cognitive deficits in intellectually threatening environments

**Study 1**:  
We expected primed thoughts of confidence or doubt to interact with participants' initial experience of anxiety in the situation to predict working memory.  
When primed with doubt, anxiety should predict lower working memory, but when primed with confidence, this relationship should be mitigated.  


**Study 2**:  
We hypothesized that when the situation was described as a diagnostic test, women primed with thoughts of doubt would show a negative relationship between their anxiety levels and working memory.  
However, priming women with thoughts of confidence was expected to attenuate if not reverse this pattern.  
In contrast, when the primary task was described as a simple problem-solving exercise, we expected our manipulation of confidence and doubt to have little effect on working memory, either direcly or in interaction with initial anxiety levels.

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

**Study 1 and 2**:

### Study timing
*Please indicate all that apply and give further details where possible.*

*If the study examines one or more samples, but each at only one point in time it is cross-sectional.*  
*If the study examines the same samples, but as they have changed over time, it is retrospective, provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking backwards over time.*  
*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?
*If at least one of the outcome variables is measured both before and after the intervention, please use the before and after category.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not an evaluation)  
- [ ] Before and after  
- [ ] Only after  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  


## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  
- [ ] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### How do the groups differ?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

**Study 1**:  
- 2 (prime: confidence vs. doubt) x 2 (ehtnicity: White vs minority)  

**Study 2**:  
- 2 (task frame: diagnostic vs. neutral) x 2 (prime: confidence vs doubt).  

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One  
- [ ] Two  
- [ ] Three  
- [x] Four or more (please specify)  
- [ ] Other/unclear (please specify)  

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [ ] Not applicate (no prospective allocation)  
- [x] Random  
- [ ] Quasi-random  
- [ ] Non-random  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

- [ ] Not applicable (no prospective allocation)  
- [x] Yes (please specify)  
- [ ] No (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)

### Study design summary 
*In addition to answering the questions in this section, describe the study design in your own words. You may want to draw upon and elaborate the answers you have already given.*

**Study 1**:  
1. participants were told that they would be completing several computerized tasks, including an initial verbal analogy test, other basic memory and categorization tasks, including an initial verbal analogy test, other basic memory and categorization tasks, and finally a second verbal analogy test.
2. All participants were told that the verbal analogy tests were highly predictive of performance on a variety of intelligence tests and that some people are better able to perform these tasks than others (instructions designed to elicit stereotype threat for minorities)
3. Demographic questions, including item about their ethnicity
4. five moderately difficult verbal analogy items that were taken from the GRE and were then asked to report the level of anxiety they were experiencing at the time
5. Participants completed a modified working memory task that contained sentences designed to prime either confidence or doubt
6. followed by a questionnaire that included a manipulation check of stereotype threat
7. were informed that they were not completing the second part of the verbal analogy test
8. debriefing  

**Study 2**:

   - The ethnicity of the participants, the type of prime they received, and the centred anxiety variable were entered in the first step of the model
   - The two-way interaction variables (e.g. Anxiety x Prime) were entered in the second step of the model, and the three-way interaction variable was entered in the last step.  
   

**Study 2**:  
*Manipulation check for stereotype threat*:
- 2 (prime) x (task frame) ANOVA was conducted on participants' rating of concern that the researcher would judge women's abilities based on their personal performance  
*Anxiety Ratings*:
- 2 (prime) x 2 (task frame) ANOVA was conducted on participants' self-reported anxiety scores  
- simple effects tests  
*Working memory*:  
Time spent reading sentences:

- [ ] Details

**Study 1**:  
*Manipulation Check of Stereotype Threat*:  
- As predicted, minority students were more concerned about their performance reflecting on their group than were Whites.  
*Anxiety*:
- ANOVa yielded no main effect for prime or a Prime x Ethnicity interaction
- There was, however, a marginal main effect for ethnicity
- Minorities reported marginally higher levels of anxiety compared to Whites 
- Thus, the stereotype threat manipulation engendered some feelings of anxiety among minority participants.  
*Working memory*:  
Sentence reading time:
   - ANOVA yielded no main effects or interactions
   - Thus, participants read the neutral sentences at the same pace as the prime sentences  
Word recall:
   - main effect for anxiety
   - main effect was qualified by the predicted two-way interaction between anxiety and the type of prime
   - Anxiety predicted lower working memory scores in the doubt condition but not in the confidence condition
   - at 1 SD above mean of anxiety, those primed with doubt had significantly lower working memory scores than those primed with confidence
   - Pattern was reversed at 1 SD below the mean of anxiety
   - No other effects were significant including the three-way interaction among ethnicity, prime type, and anxiety
   - Lack of prime main effect suggests that thoughts of doubt (vs. confidence) did not promote cognitive interference overall and that the lack of a significant three-way interaction with ethnicity reveals that the moderated pattern observed was not significantly different between White and minority participants.  
   

**Study 2**:  
*Manipulation Check of Stereotype Threat*:  
- Women led to believe that they would be taking a diagnostic maths test reported more concern about how their gender would be evaluated compared with women in the neutral condition
- No other effects were significant
- Manipulation of stereotype threat was effective in eliciting group-based performance concerns  
*Anxiety Ratings*:  
- ANOVA produced an unexpected interaction
- Although the simple effects tests were not significant, women subsequently assigned to the doubt prime condition reported somewhat more anxiety in the diagnostic condition compared to the neutral condition
- Anxiety ratings were reversed between the diagnostic and neutral conditions among women subsequently assigned to receive confidence primes
- As our primary hypothesis concerns the relationship that these anxiety ratings have with working memory, rather than simple mean differences in working memory between the four conditions, these initial condition differences in anxiety are partialed out of our analysis of working memory, minimizing any effect they could have.  
*Working memory*:  
Time spent reading sentences:  
   - ANOVA revealed no significant main effect or interactions  
Word recall:  
   - Analysis revealed no significant main effects or two-way interactions
   - the predicted three-way interaction among task frame, prime, and anxiety level was significant
   - Simple interaction analyses revealed that the Anxiety x Prime interaction observed in Study 1 was only significant in the diagnostic task frame condition and was not significant in the neutral task frame condition
   - Simple slope analyses within the diagnostic task frame condition further revealed that at 1 SD above the mean of anxiety, women primed with doubt had significantly lower working memory scores compared with women primed with confidence.
   - At 1 SD below the mean of anxiety, the prime manipulation had no effect on working memory
   - In addition, within the diagnostic task frame condition, women primed with doubt who reported higher levels of anxiety tended to have lower working memory scores compared with women who reported lower levels of anxiety
   - This pattern was reversed but was not significant among women who received confidence primes
   - Thus, consistent with our hypothesis, primed thoughts of doubt significantly altered the relationship between anxiety and working memory, but only among women expecting to take a diagnostic maths test.

**Study 1**:  
Results supported our hypothesis that although individuals vary in the degree to which they experience anxiety in an intellectually threatening environment, the valence of their thoughts can alter whether that anxiety predicts cognitive impairments
- When individuals experience heightened anxiety in an intellectual performance situation, they subsequently exhibit lower working memory but only when primed with thoughts of doubt 
- By comparison, anxiety did not predict lower working memory when participants had been primed with thoughts of confidence
- This occurred regardless of ethnicity of participant, suggesting that metacognitive processes might play a general role in self-relevant performance situations, such as high-stakes intellectual testing


**Study 2**:  
Results replicated findings in Study 1 with a different stigmatized group.
Primed thoughts of confidence or doubt moderated the relationships that anxiety had with women's working memory only when women were placed in a stereotype-threatening environment.
Specifically, women who experienced higher levels of anxiety under stereotype threat exhibited somewhat lower working memory when they were primed with doubt.
Conversely, priming women with confidence buffered them from this relationship under stereotype threat.
However, when the situation was framed in a less self-relevant way, anxiety did not predict women's working memory.
Presumably, this less threatening frame did not promote the level of self-evaluation required to elicit metacognitive interpretation of anxiety in light of primed thoguhts of doubt.
