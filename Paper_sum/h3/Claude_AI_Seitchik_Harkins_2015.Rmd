The study was carried out in the United States, at a northeastern university.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines stereotype threat effects on mental arithmetic performance, comparing working memory interference and motivational (mere effort) accounts. It investigates how stereotype threat affects problem-solving strategies and performance on horizontal and vertical subtraction problems.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study tests two competing hypotheses:
1. Working memory account: Stereotype threat impairs performance on horizontal subtraction problems by occupying phonological loop resources with worries.
2. Mere effort account: Stereotype threat motivates participants to perform well, potentiating the prepotent response on the task.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measures:
- Math performance (number of problems solved correctly, accuracy)
- Problem-solving strategies (method of adjustment vs. traditional method)
- Direction of digit entry (left-to-right vs. right-to-left)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Measurements were taken after the stereotype threat manipulation was implemented.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to stereotype threat or no threat conditions.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed based on the stereotype threat manipulation. Stereotype threat participants were told the task had been shown to produce gender differences, while no threat participants were told it had not.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

Stereotype threat and no threat groups.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not provide information on allocation concealment.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

All participants completed the same math tasks, with the only difference being the stereotype threat manipulation.

### Study design summary 

This study used a randomized experimental design to compare the effects of stereotype threat on mental arithmetic performance. Female participants were randomly assigned to stereotype threat or no threat conditions and completed horizontal and vertical subtraction problems. The study manipulated problem orientation (horizontal vs. vertical) and direction of digit entry (left-to-right vs. right-to-left) to test competing working memory and motivational accounts of stereotype threat effects.

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

- [x] Details

The results are presented through text descriptions, statistical test results, and figures showing mean performance across conditions.

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

The key results relevant to H3 are:
1. Stereotype threat participants performed worse than no threat participants on horizontal subtraction problems when entering answers from right-to-left.
2. Stereotype threat participants performed better than no threat participants on horizontal subtraction problems when entering answers from left-to-right.
3. Stereotype threat participants performed better than no threat participants on vertical subtraction problems.
4. When instructed to use a specific problem-solving method, stereotype threat participants outperformed no threat participants on horizontal modular arithmetic problems.

These results do not support H3, as they do not show a consistent impairment in working memory performance under stereotype threat.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [ ] Yes
   - [x] No
   - [ ] Can't tell

The authors do not report confidence intervals for the effects.

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors report on all variables specified in their research questions, including math performance, problem-solving strategies, and direction of digit entry.

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

### Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The experimental design with manipulation of stereotype threat, problem orientation, and digit entry direction was appropriate for testing the competing hypotheses.

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A lot (please specify)

The experimental design with random assignment and manipulation of multiple factors (stereotype threat, problem orientation, digit entry direction) helps rule out alternative explanations. However, the lack of information on sample selection and potential confounding variables limits the ability to completely rule out all sources of bias.

### How generalisable are the study results?

The results may be generalizable to female university students in mathematics-related contexts. However, the generalizability is limited by the lack of information on sample characteristics and the specific population sampled from a single northeastern university in the United States.
