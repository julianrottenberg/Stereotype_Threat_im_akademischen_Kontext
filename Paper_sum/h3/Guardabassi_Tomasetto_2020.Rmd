**H1:** We examined, for the first time, whether a negative association between BMI and working memory (i.e., a decrease in working memory associated with higher levels of BMI) emerges among children with obesity when working memory tasks are labelled as an assessment of stereotype-related cognitive abilities (i.e., as an intelligence test) as compared with when the same tasks are labelled as nondiagnostic tools (i.e., when stereotype threat is removed).  

**H2:** We investigated whether experiences of weight stigmatization (e.g. being teased by peers due to one's overweight) strengthens the negative relation between a children's BMI and working memory under stereotype threat.  

**H3:** We investigated whether experiences of personal endorsement of the intelligence obesity stereotype threat strengthens the negative relation between a children's BMI and working memory under stereotype threat.

### Study timing
*Please indicate all that apply and give further details where possible.*

*If the study examines one or more samples, but each at only one point in time it is cross-sectional.*  
*If the study examines the same samples, but as they have changed over time, it is retrospective, provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking backwards over time.*  
*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?
*If at least one of the outcome variables is measured both before and after the intervention, please use the before and after category.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not an evaluation)  
- [x] Before and after  
- [ ] Only after  
- [ ] Other (please specify)

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  
- [ ] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### How do the groups differ?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

- Stereotype threatening condition vs non-steretype threatening condition  

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One  
- [x] Two  
- [ ] Three  
- [ ] Four or more (please specify)

- [ ] Not applicate (no prospective allocation)  
- [x] Random  
- [ ] Quasi-random  
- [ ] Non-random  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

- [ ] Details

- table 1 displays descriptive statistics and bivariate correlation
- Stigma experiences were more prevalent at increased levels of zBMI
- Endorsement of the obesity stereotype about intelligence was unrelated to zBMI
- Results from the mixed-effects model revealed that the main effect of N-back difficulty, were significant, whereas the main effect of condition was not
- H1, the two-way interaction between zBMI and condition was significant, indicating that the relation between body weight and working memory varied depending on the presence of stereotype threat
- This effect was not further qualified by the three-way interaction among zBMI, condition, and N-back difficulty, suggesting that the impairing effect of stereotype threat on the relation between zBMI and working memory did not vary in strength or direction at different levels of task difficulty.
- Two-way interactions were N-back levels and zBMI, and between N-back levels and condition were also non-significant
- Simple slopes analyses revealed that working memory scores declined by 0.35 SD per unit of increase in children's zBMI in the ST condition
- The relation between zBMI and working memory was null in the NST condition
- Regarding the role of potential moderators (H2 and H3), the interaction between participants' zBMI and condition was not further qualified by either weight-based stigma experiences, or endorsement of the obesity stereotype about intelligence.
- Fit indices were markedly worse when the three-way interactions among zBMI, condition, and stigma experiences and among zBMI, condition, and stereotype endorsement were included in the models.

- [ ] Details

The current study is the first to demonstrate that the assessment of working memory in children with excess weight may yield biased results. Specifically, our findings indicate that a decrease in working memory at increasing levels of body weight emerged only when children were told that a working memory task assessed their intelligence. When concerns about the capability of the test to diagnose intelligence were removed, children with excess weight performed at levles that were indistinguishable from those children with average weight.  
We also investigated whether the negative relation between body weight and working memory was strengthened among children who had more often been the target of weight-based teasing or among those who personally avowed that children with obesity are less intelligent. Neither of these two personal characteristics emerged as a relevant moderator.  
Similarly, gender, age, and (contrary to our expectation) task difficulty did not moderate the explored relation, possibly because weight stigma equally affects boys and girls during middle childhood and may impair performance even on tasks demanding relatively low cognitive control.  
Our findings concerning the role of weight-based stereotypes in hampering executive functions during middle childhood parallel our prior research with adults and have far-reaching developmental implications.  

Limitations of this study should be considered. For example, the ethnic-homogeneous convenience sample of this study limits the generalization of findings to other cultural groups. In addition, measurement of potential moderators could be strengthened in future studies by including no only direct teasing by peers but also more subtle forms of stigma experience (e.g., exposure to obesity stereotype in media) or more overt ones (e.g. bullying). Moreover, measures of weight bias internalization, which is a strong predictor of obesity-related health and psychological complications should also be included in future work. This is particularly important because stereotype threat susceptibility in children may depend more on implicit attitudes and cognitions than on explicit ones. Finally, because group identification is a potential moderator of stereotype threat, future studies may take into account children's subjective identification with their weight status group.

In conclusion, this study offers a new explanation for the observed working memory deficits associated with child obesity.
