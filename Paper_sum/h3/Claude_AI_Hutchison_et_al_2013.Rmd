### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States, specifically at Montana State University.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how stereotype threat affects working memory processes, specifically goal maintenance and response competition, using the Stroop task. It manipulates stereotype threat by framing the task as measuring "verbal skills of men and women" vs. general "processing skills".

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study aimed to test two main hypotheses:
1. The distraction hypothesis: Stereotype threat would impair goal maintenance, leading to increased errors on mostly congruent Stroop trials.
2. The response competition hypothesis: Stereotype threat would impair the ability to resolve response competition, leading to slower reaction times on mostly incongruent Stroop trials.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measured:
- Working memory capacity (using the Operation Span task)
- Stroop task performance (errors and reaction times)
- Stereotype threat condition (threat vs. control)
- Stroop list type (mostly congruent vs. mostly incongruent)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study collected data from participants at a single time point.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Stroop task performance was measured after the stereotype threat manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to either the stereotype threat or control condition, and to either the mostly congruent or mostly incongruent Stroop list condition.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in:
1. Stereotype threat condition: threat vs. control
2. Stroop list type: mostly congruent vs. mostly incongruent

### Number of groups

- [x] Four or more (please specify)  

There were four groups: 2 (stereotype threat vs. control) x 2 (mostly congruent vs. mostly incongruent list)

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state whether allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

All participants completed the same tasks (Operation Span and Stroop), with the only differences being the experimental manipulations.

### Study design summary 

This study used a 2 (stereotype threat: threat vs. control) x 2 (list type: mostly congruent vs. mostly incongruent) between-subjects design. Participants first completed the Operation Span task to measure working memory capacity, then were randomly assigned to conditions for the Stroop task. The Stroop task was framed either as a measure of verbal skills (stereotype threat) or processing skills (control). Stroop performance (errors and reaction times) was measured as the primary outcome.

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

- [x] Details

Results are presented through text descriptions of statistical findings and a figure showing predicted values for the three-way interaction.

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

The main findings were:
1. Stereotype threat increased Stroop errors, particularly in the mostly congruent list condition.
2. This effect was moderated by working memory capacity, with low-WMC individuals showing greater stereotype threat effects.
3. No evidence was found for the response competition hypothesis (no effects on reaction times in the mostly incongruent condition).

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?

- [x] Yes

The authors report beta values, t-values, and p-values for all main effects and interactions.

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

The data appear to be reported comprehensively and clearly.

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?
