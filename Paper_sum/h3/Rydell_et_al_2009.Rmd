- We sought to document how the availability of multiple social identities impacts the cognitive substrates governing maths problem solving.
- In the present experiment, we examined whether those in the mulitple-identities condition, who receive both college student and gender stereotypes, might not experience the compromises of working memory typically observed when women's gender stereotypes are available.

We expected that participants in the gender identity condition would show poorer working memory capacity presumably because of intrusive thoughts and verbal ruminations associated with being under stereotype threat, which, in turn, would impair maths performance.  
In this condition, gender identity should be accessible (see Experiment 2) as well as the imbalance between concepts of self, group, and ability domain.  
However, we expected participants in the multiple-identities condition, because of their greater identification with being a college students, would show no relative decrements in working memory capacity because the accessibility of the college student identity would presumably reduce intrusive thoughts and worries about the stereotype that women are bad at maths.  
This should result in consonance between propositions about the self, group, and ability domain, and thus maths performance should not suffer.  
Those in the control condition and in the college identity condition are also expected to show relatively better maths performance than the gender identity condition (replacing Experiment 1 and 2) and not reveal compromised working memory capacity because gender stereotyepes were not made salient to them.  

## Methods - Design

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)

### Study timing
*Please indicate all that apply and give further details where possible.*

*If the study examines one or more samples, but each at only one point in time it is cross-sectional.*  
*If the study examines the same samples, but as they have changed over time, it is retrospective, provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking backwards over time.*  
*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?
*If at least one of the outcome variables is measured both before and after the intervention, please use the before and after category.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not an evaluation)  
- [ ] Before and after  
- [ ] Only after  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  


## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  
- [ ] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### How do the groups differ?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

- 2 (college student stereotype: absent vs present) x 2 (gender stereotype: absent vs present) between-subjects factorial design.  

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One  
- [ ] Two  
- [ ] Three  
- [x] Four or more (please specify)

- [ ] Not applicate (no prospective allocation)  
- [x] Random  
- [ ] Quasi-random  
- [ ] Non-random  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?
*Please give details and refer to page numbers in the report(s) of the study where necessary (e.g. for key tables).*

- [ ] Details

*Maths performance*:
- ANOVA revealed the anticipated two-way interaction
- Simple effects analyses revealed that when participants were not given gender stereotypes, performance was equally strong regardless of the presentation of college student stereotypes.
- When participants were given the gender stereotype, those who received college student stereotypes performed better than those who did not receive college student stereotypes
- Consistent with Experiments 1 - 2, maths performance in the gender identity condition was significantly poorer than in the three other conditions, which did not differ from one another.  

*Working memory capacity*:
- ANOVA revealed a significant interaction 
- Simple effects analyses showed that when participants were not given gender stereotypes, working memory capacity (as assessed by the number of words recalled) did not differ as a function of the presentation of college student stereotypes
- When given gender stereotypes, those who did not receive college student stereotypes (i.e., multiple-identities condition) recalled fewer words than those who received college student stereotypes (i.e., gender identity condition)
- Working memory capacity in the gender identity condition was significantly lower than in the three other conditions, which did not differ from one another.
- Thus, the condition in which the poorest maths problem performance was produces (i.e., the gender identity condition) was also the condition in which the lowest working memory capacity was revealed as assessed by the word recall analyses.
- We also examined hte accuracy of vowel counting in a 2 x 2 ANOVA, which revealed no significant effects.  

*Mediational analyses*:
- The independent variable (i.e., the interaction between college student and gender stereotype manipulations) mad a unique contribution in predicting the dependent variable (i.e, maths performance) when the main effect of college student and gender stereotypes were included in the regression equation
- Also, the independent variable (the interaction term) made a unique contribution in predicting the mediator variable (i.e., working memory capacity) when the main effects of positive and negative stereotypic information were statistically controlled
- In addition, the mediator variable also predicted the dependent variable
- Thus, participants had their maths performance simultaneously regressed on the manipulation of college student stereotypes, the manipulation of gender stereotypes, the interaction of these manipulations, and on working memory capacity.
- This multiple regression revealed that when working memory capacity was included, the relation between the interaction of college student and gender stereotypes and maths performance was no longer significant.
- A Sobel test demonstrated that working memory capacity accounted for a significant amount of variance in the relation between maths performance and the interaction between college student and gender stereotypes
- Thus, working memory full mediated the relation between maths performance and the interaction between college student and gender stereotypes.

- [ ] Details

Experiment 3 further elucidated the processes by which the availability of a social identity associated with positive stereotypes eradicates the impact of a social identity associated with a negative stereotype.
Concurrently providing women with two applicable social identities, one associated with positive stereotypes in a performance domain (i.e., college students are good at maths) and one associated with negative stereotypes in a performance domain (i.e., women are bad at maths; the typical condition that evokes stereotype threat), once again eliminated the averse impact on performance typically seen in stereotype threat research.  
Specifically, when the social identity available to these women was associated with a negative performances stereotype, their working memory capacity was compromised, and performance suffered.
However, the availability of an additional identity associated with positive performance did not lead to working memory depletion, and accordingly, performance did not suffer despite the fact that one's gender was also highlighted.
Thus, Experiments 2 and 3 show the processes, both in terms of social identity accessibility and working memory capacity through which stereotype threat for women in a maths task can be eliminated by introducing an additional social identity associated with a positive performance.
