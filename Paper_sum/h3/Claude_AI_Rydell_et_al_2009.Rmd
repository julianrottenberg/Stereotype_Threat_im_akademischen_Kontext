The authors state that "This research was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant BCS 0601148, Institute of Education Sciences Grant R305H050004, NSF CAREER Grant DRL-0746970, and by the Lewis Endowed Professorship."

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on how activating multiple social identities with conflicting stereotypes about math ability affects stereotype threat and math performance in women. It examines the cognitive processes underlying these effects, particularly working memory.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is female college students.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 17 - 20  
- [x] 21 and over  

The study focused on female undergraduate students, who typically fall in the 17-22 age range.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Female only  

The study focused exclusively on female participants.

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

The study was conducted with undergraduate students at universities.

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States, specifically at the University of Missouri and Indiana University.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how activating multiple social identities (woman and college student) with conflicting stereotypes about math ability affects stereotype threat and math performance in women. It investigates the cognitive processes underlying these effects, particularly focusing on working memory capacity and social identity accessibility.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The authors explicitly state several hypotheses, including:

1. Presenting both positive (college student) and negative (female) stereotypes about math ability would eliminate stereotype threat effects on math performance.

2. This effect would be mediated by greater accessibility of the college student identity relative to the female identity.

3. Working memory capacity would be reduced in the gender identity condition but not in the multiple identities condition, mediating the effects on math performance.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measures:
- Math performance
- Working memory capacity
- Accessibility of social identities (female and college student)
- Stereotype threat manipulation (through instructions about gender and college student stereotypes)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study used a cross-sectional design, measuring outcomes at a single time point for each participant.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Measurements of math performance, working memory, and identity accessibility were made after the stereotype threat manipulations.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions manipulating the availability of gender and college student stereotypes.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in the stereotype information they received:
1. Control (no stereotypes)
2. College identity (positive college student stereotype)
3. Gender identity (negative female stereotype)
4. Multiple identities (both positive college and negative female stereotypes)

### Number of groups

- [x] Four or more (please specify)  

There were four groups as described above.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state whether allocation was concealed, though it appears likely given the experimental design.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

All groups completed the same math test and working memory tasks, differing only in the stereotype information they received.

### Study design summary 

This study used a 2 (college student stereotype: present, absent) x 2 (gender stereotype: present, absent) between-subjects factorial design. Female undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions manipulating the availability of positive (college student) and negative (female) stereotypes about math ability. Participants completed measures of math performance, working memory capacity, and social identity accessibility.
