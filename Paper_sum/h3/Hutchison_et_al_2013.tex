\item
  A \emph{distraction} hypothesis would predict that stereotype threatened individuals become distracted and start to mind wander during the task, which interferes with their ability to maintain the task goal of naming colours not words. If stereotype threat causes distraction, threat effects should emerge specifically on error rates within mostly congruent lists in which task goals must be internally supported. Such a pattern of results would suggest stereotype threat impairs the target individuals' ability to stay focused on their test-taking strategy and goals for successful test performance.
\item
  A \emph{response competition} hypothesis would predict that stereotype threat impairs peoples' ability to resolve the competition created by the incorrect, but habitual, word response. This response competition hypothesis predicts stereotype threat effect emerge in Stroop RTs within mostly incongruent lists in which goals are externally supported. Such a pattern of results would suggest that stereotype threat impairs the speed with which target individuals can override their (incorrect) habitual responses.
\item
  Stereotype threat may impair both the ability to avoid distraction and to resolve response competition, in which both hypotheses would be correct and stereotype threat effects should emerge both in Stroop error rates under mostly congruent lists and in Stroop RTs within mostly incongruent lists.

\emph{Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the `new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.}

\end{itemize}

\emph{Testing the Distraction Hypothesis}:\\
- The overall model was significant and revealed the typical effect of list congruency and WMC on Stroop errors, whereby participants' Stroop effects were greater in the mostly congruent list than the mostly incongruent list, and participants lower in WMC had larger Stroop effects than those higher in WMC.
- Replicating Hutchison (2011), these two main effects were qualified by their two-way interaction
- Stratified analyses by list-type showed WMC differences in Stroop effects were pronounced among those receiving the mostly congruent list but absent among those receiving the mostly incongruent list
- There was a main effect of stereotype threat, such that men in the stereotype threat condition had a larger Stroop effect than those in the control condition
- This stereotype threat main effect was qualified by an interaction with list condition
- Stratified analyses by list-type showed stereotype threat increased Stroop errors among those in the mostly congruent list, but not among those in the mostly incongruent list
- There was also a marginal two-way interaction between threat condition and WMC.
- These main effects and two-way interactions were qualified by a significant three-way interaction between stereotype threat, list congruency, and WMC
- TO decompose the interaction, we tested the Simple Stereotype Threat x WMC interaction separately for each list and then, if significant, determined the effects of stereotype threat separately for those relatively high and low in WMC
- For the mostly congruent list, the two-way Stereotype threat x WMC interaction was significant
- Comparison of the simple slopes in the mostly congruent list at 1 SD below the mean WMC revealed a significant slope for the stereotype threat condition, with Stroop effects increasing under stereotype threat
- The simple slope analysis at 1 SD above the mean WMC did not reveal significant difference
- Within the mostly congruent list, in which internal goal maintenance is required for successful performance, those with lower WMC made more Stroop errors in the stereotype threat condition compared to the control condition
- In contrast to the mostly congruent list, the two-way Stereotype Threat x WMC interaction was not significant among those in the mostly incongruent list, suggesting no effect of stereotype threat on Stroop performance.
- As predicted by the distraction hypothesis, these results suggest that stereotype threat interferes with goal maintenance particularly among low-WMC individuals, presumably due to their increased susceptibility to distraction
- Specifically, low-WMC individuals showed increased Stroop errors under stereotype threat for the mostly congruent list
- Within the mostly incongruent list, stereotype threat had no effect on Stroop performance, regardless of WMC.

\emph{Testing the Response Competition Hypothesis}:
- Stroop RT effects were regressed on the model, which was also significant
- The only significant effects were a main effect of WMC in which Stroop RT effects were larger for low-WMC individuals and a main effect of list in which Stroop effects were larger in the mostly congruent list.
- These findings replicate previous reserach
- No other main effect or two-way interactions emerged, and the three-way interaction did not approach statistical significance.

As predicted by the distraction hypothesis, stereotype threat produced a significant increase in Stroop errors among those low in WMC only under conditions in which the task goal had to be internally maintained (i.e., mostly congruent list). In contrast, when the task goal was externally supported through frequent exposure to incongruent stimuli, no such disruption occurred. These findings support the hypothesis that stereotype threat impairs performance on conflict tasks by disrupting peoples' ability to maintain focus throughout the task. The distraction caused by stereotype threat--related thoughts leads to a loss of the appropriate goal to suppress habitual, yet incorrect, response tendencies.\\
Our results did not support the response competition hypothesis, neither low- nor high-WMC individuals showed stereotype threat-induced response competition effects. Therefore, we found evidence that stereotype threat exerts its debilitating effect primarily through goal neglect, but found no evidence that stereotype threat weakens one's ability to resolve response competition.

In summary, results from the current study clearly demonstrate that under stereotype threat, a disruption in goal maintenance occurs during task engagement, especially among those low in WMC. We posit that subtly triggered stereotype threat effects reflect goal-neglect problems in which individuals (particularly those low in WMC) become distracted following the threat and begin mind wandering. This mind wandering then causes goal-neglect, which impairs performance in attention-demanding situations such as those involving planning, troubleshooting, technical difficulty, or novel sequences of action (Norman \& Shallice, 1986).

Our data suggest mind wandering is an important reason why stereotype threat produces such varied outcomes as counterproductive leadership communication styles (von Hippel, Wiryakusuma, Bowden, \& Shochet, 2011) and impaired driving skills among women (Yeung \& von Hippel, 2008). Indeed, we suggest that stereotype threat effects will be greatest not only among those chronically prone to distraction (i.e., individuals low in WMC or diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)), but to all individuals during states of impaired WMC such as that during divided attention, ego-depletion (Carr \& Steele, 2010), or off-peak circadian rhythms (Hasher, Zacks, \& May, 1999).
