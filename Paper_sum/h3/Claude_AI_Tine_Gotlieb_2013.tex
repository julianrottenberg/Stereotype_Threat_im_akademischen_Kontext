  \item
    What these are (numerically if appropriate)
  \item
    How were the results expressed (NNT, odds ratio, etc)
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Can the results be applied to the local population?}\label{can-the-results-be-applied-to-the-local-population}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider whether:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

    The patients covered by the review could be sufficiently different from your population to cause concern
  \item
    Your local setting is likely to differ much from that of the review
  \end{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Can't tell
\end{itemize}

The applicability to local populations would depend on how similar they are to the college student sample in this study.

\subsubsection{Were all important outcomes considered?}\label{were-all-important-outcomes-considered}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Yes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Even if this is not addressed by the review, what do you think?
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Can't tell
\end{itemize}

The study does not discuss potential harms or costs of the research. The benefits of understanding stereotype threat effects could potentially outweigh minimal risks to participants, but this is not explicitly addressed.
