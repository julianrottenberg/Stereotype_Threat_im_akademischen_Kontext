### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by existing research on stereotype threat, the default mode network (DMN), and self-oriented processing. The authors cite previous work showing that stereotype threat can impair performance and lead to negative self-appraisals (e.g., Steele & Aronson, 1995; Schmader et al., 2008). They also discuss prior research on the DMN and its role in self-related cognition (e.g., Raichle et al., 2001; Buckner et al., 2008).

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)

The paper does not include any information about funding sources.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on stereotype threat, neural correlates of self-oriented processing (specifically default mode network connectivity), and performance perceptions in academic settings.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is on white and racial minority (Latino and African American) undergraduate students.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 17 - 20  
- [x] 21 and over  

The study used undergraduate students, so the relevant age groups likely span both 17-20 and 21 and over.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Mixed sex  

The study included both male and female participants.

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

The study was conducted with undergraduate students at a university.

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States. This is evident from the mention of "permanent US residents" in the participants section.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study is concerned with:
1. Stereotype threat effects on minority students' performance perceptions and self-doubt
2. Default mode network (DMN) connectivity as measured by EEG phase-locking between key DMN regions
3. The relationship between DMN connectivity and performance perceptions/self-doubt under stereotype threat

### What are the study research questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study aimed to address the following research questions:
1. How does stereotype threat impact neural activation patterns and cognitive processes in academic settings?
2. What are the specific neural and cognitive mechanisms through which stereotype threat influences academic performance?

The authors hypothesized that individual differences in DMN connectivity (measured as baseline neural synchrony) would be associated with stigmatized minorities' performance perceptions in a stereotype threatening context.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measured:
1. EEG phase-locking between DMN regions (LLPC-P/PCC and LLPC-MPFC) in theta and alpha bands
2. Performance on a probabilistic learning task
3. Post-task error estimations
4. Post-task self-doubt
5. Perceptions of stereotype threat

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study collected data at a single time point for each participant.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Not applicable (not an evaluation)

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  

The study compared white and racial minority (Latino and African American) students based on their pre-existing racial/ethnic group membership.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed by race/ethnicity: white students vs. racial minority students (Latino and African American).

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

The study compared two groups: white students and racial minority students.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Not applicate (no prospective allocation)

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not applicable (no prospective allocation)

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [x] Can't tell

The paper does not provide enough information to determine if the groups were treated exactly the same apart from the inherent differences in their experiences of stereotype threat.

### Study design summary 

This was a cross-sectional study comparing white and racial minority undergraduate students. Participants completed baseline EEG measurements, followed by a probabilistic learning task framed as an intelligence test to induce stereotype threat in minority students. Post-task measures included error estimations and self-doubt ratings. The study examined relationships between DMN connectivity (measured by EEG phase-locking) and performance perceptions/self-doubt, with a focus on how these relationships differed between white and minority students.

The experimenter was aware of participants' race/ethnicity, which was a key factor in the study.

### Where were the data collected?

- [x] Unclear/not stated (please specify)

The paper does not specify the exact location of data collection, though it was likely in a laboratory setting at a university.

### Are there other important features of data collection?

- [x] Details

EEG data was collected during a baseline resting period and during the probabilistic learning task. The task was framed as an intelligence test to induce stereotype threat.

## Methods - Data analysis

### Which methods were used to analyse the data?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study used source localization and time-frequency analyses for EEG data, focusing on phase-locking values between DMN regions. Moderated regression analyses were used to examine relationships between DMN phase-locking, ethnicity, and outcome variables.

### Which statistical methods, if any, were used in the analysis?

### Do the authors describe strategies used in the analysis to control for bias from confounding variables?

- [x] Details

The authors included ethnicity as a moderator in their analyses to control for potential confounding effects. They also examined the effects of gender but found no significant effects.

### Please describe any other important features of the analysis.

- [x] Details

The authors focused on spontaneous phase-locking during the baseline resting period rather than during the task itself, as they were interested in individual differences in DMN connectivity that might predict responses to stereotype threat.

### Please comment on any other analytic or statistical issues if relevant.

- [x] Details

The authors acknowledge limitations in their EEG source localization due to using only 32 channels. They also note that they assumed standard electrode placement without direct verification.

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

- [x] Details

Results are presented through a combination of descriptive statistics, correlation tables, and figures showing moderated regression results. The authors also report statistical test results (e.g., b values, p-values) in the text.

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

Key findings include:
1. Minorities with greater LPC-P/PCC phase-locking in the theta band reported more accurate error estimations.
2. All individuals, but especially minorities, experienced less self-doubt to the extent they exhibited greater LPC-MPFC phase-locking in the alpha band.
3. Minorities reported more self-doubt to the extent they overestimated errors.
4. There were no differences between whites and minorities in actual task performance or overall levels of self-doubt.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [ ] Yes
   - [x] No
   - [ ] Can't tell

The study did not report confidence intervals for the main effects.

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors report on all key variables mentioned in their research questions, including DMN phase-locking, error estimations, and self-doubt.

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

- [x] No

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that individual differences in spontaneous phase-locking between DMN regions at rest were associated with stereotype-threatened minorities' self and performance perceptions. They suggest that greater DMN connectivity might enable more accurate performance appraisals and buffer against negative effects of stereotype threat. The authors propose that DMN phase-locking could be a novel biological marker for individual differences in stereotype threat vulnerability.

### Is there sufficient justification for why the study was done the way it was?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors provide a clear rationale for their methods, including the use of EEG to measure DMN connectivity and the choice of a probabilistic learning task.

### Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The cross-sectional design with EEG measurement and a stereotype threat manipulation was appropriate for examining the relationship between DMN connectivity and responses to stereotype threat.

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A little (please specify)

The study controls for some potential confounds (e.g., gender) and uses established methods, but the lack of random assignment and potential for selection bias limit the ability to rule out all alternative explanations.

### How generalisable are the study results?

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)

The study uses well-established methods and provides detailed analysis, but limitations in sample description and recruitment procedures somewhat reduce its trustworthiness.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?
