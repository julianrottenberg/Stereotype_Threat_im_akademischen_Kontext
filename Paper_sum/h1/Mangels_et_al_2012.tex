\subsubsection{What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?}\label{what-isare-the-topic-focusfoci-of-the-study}

The present study focused on the emotional and cognitive processes that differentiate those females who rebound from math errors under stereotype threat from those who succumb.\\
Our primary questions concerned whether ST influences females' emotional responses to negative feedback, and whether these emotional responses predicted: (i) use of the tutor (i.e.~engagement with learning) and (ii) the ability to correct the errors on a retest (i.e.~success in learning).\\
Greater vigilance and initial sensitivity to negative feedback may undermine learning by motivating individuals to regulate their arousal by distracting themselves from the tutorial learning opportunity. In contrast, attempts to regulate ones emotional response by focusing on the response itself, through either rumination or suppression, will likely divert cognitive resources from processing task-relevant information.

We focused our analysis on three ERP waveforms: the medial frontal feedback-related negativity (FRN), the anterior P3 (P3a) and the posteriorally-maximal late positive potential (LPP). Drawing upon previous research, we relate these waveforms, respectively, to the relatively automatic appraisal of feedback valence, the subsequent orienting to the feedback as a function of its motivational salience, and the sustained attentional processes that are sensitive to the subjective level of emotional arousal the feedback elicits.\\
We expect that, together, the FRN and P3a will primarily measure the effects of stereotype threat on individuals' initial sensitivity to feedback valence, whereas the LPP should track the dynamics of arousal up-regulation, as might be produced by rumination or suppression.

\emph{Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the `new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.}

\emph{In addition to answering the questions in this section, describe the study design in your own words. You may want to draw upon and elaborate the answers you have already given.}

Three days. First day: pre-measures about gender, math identification, perception of environmental stereotype threat. Second day: more questionnaires assessing mood and confidence in math ability, afterwards preparation for EEG, first round of math tasks, then received either stereotype threat or no threat framing. Thrid day (approximately 24hours later): surprise retest of math problems that wre isomorphic to those from the first test.

\textbf{Gender and math-related individual differences}\\
Gender Identification did not differ as a function of either ST or subsequent learning success. Perceptions of others' stereotypes about females' abilities relative to males' in amth (PEST) were also similar across groups, as were students' Math SAT and confidence in math ability. Math identification demonstrated a significant interaction between ST and learning. Under NT, better learners reported marginally higher math identification than poorer learners.\\
In addition, although under ST, better and poorer learners did not differ from each other, the better learners under ST reported significantly lower math identification than better learners in the NT condition.

\textbf{First-test and retest performance}:\\
ST suppressed females' overall performance on the initial test. There was no effect of ST either on overall retest performance or our measure of tutor-based error correction (i.e.~proportion corrected at retest with greater than guessing level of confidence, following some use of the tutor).\\
These results affirm that some females were able to take advantage of tutorial opportunities and rebound from math failures even under threat. Within the ST group, some individuals achieved more successful outcomes than others, despite starting from nearly identical levels of first-test impairment.

\textbf{ERP responses to performance feedback}:\\
We focused our analyses on the difference waves created by subtracting positive from negative feedback. This subtraction highlights any differential salience associated with negative feedback by treating the positive feedback response as a baseline against which the negative feedback response is compared.\\
These difference waves clearly illustrate the negative-going FRN and positive-going P3a. Yet, neither ST nor learning success were associated with significant modulations of these waveforms. Despite the appearance of an enhances \(P3a_{diff}\) in poorer learners under ST, exploratory pair-wise comparisons between better and poorer learners as a function of threat condition confirmed that there were no significant differences as a function of learning success.\\
Learning success was directly related to the more sustained attention and emotional arousal processes as indexed by the LPP. An enhanced \(LPP_{diff}\) was found in poorer learners only, supporting the general hypothesis that sustained emotional processing of negative feedback would interfere with learning success. Although no significant effects of ST nor interactions between threat and learning were found, exploratory pair-wise comparisons indicated that ST was largely driving this effect, even though a similar trend could be found under NT. This finding suggests that stereotypes may indeed selectively increase the emotional burden of negative feedback on learning.

\textbf{Engagement with tutor following errors}:\\
First, we asked whether the frequency with which students made some attempt to investigate the tutor differed as a function of threat or learning success. There were no significant group differences in the basic measure of tutor entry. However, when we probed the depth of tutor engagement for tutors that were entered, we found that deeper exploration within the tutor led to greater overall success in solving isomorphic retest problems. This effect was moderated by the precence of threat, in that the quantity of exploration was related to error correction only under NT. Under ST, better and poorer learners appeared to make similar efforts to investigate the tutor, at a level that was marginally shallower than the better learners under NT, but did not differ from the poorer learners under NT. This suggests that poorer learners in the ST condition were retaining less information from their investigation of the tutor than were the better learners in this condition.

\textbf{Structural equation modelling of retest success}:\\
Figure 3B and C.\\
As can be seen by comparing the optimized models of ST and NT, the response to negative feedback played a much greater role in determining error correction success under ST than under NT conditions.\\
Under ST, the initial detection of negative outcome significantly predicted how deeply females attempted to explore the tutor, with those who had a more negative-going \(FRN_{diff}\) withdrawing effort from the tutor earlier. Tutor engagement then marginally predicted error correction. Taken together, these results lend some support to the disengagement hypothesis, in that they revealed a mediated relationship between \(FRN_{diff}\) and error correction that was not apparent in our univariate analyses. In contrast, the significant direct path from the \(LPP_{diff}\) to error correction under ST is more consistent with the interference hypothesis, and suggests that sustained emotional processing interfered with the quality of information extracted from the tutor.\\
These results suggest that ST can undermine learning through either reduced quality or quantity of tutor engagement, and furthermore, that these effects are linked to different components of the emotional response to negative feedback. Although we acknowledge that the \(FRN_{diff}\) and \(P3a_{diff}\) also demonstrated marginally significant direct paths to learning outcome under ST, it is also important to note that these paths accounted for as much less variance than the direct path between the \(LPP_{diff}\) and error correction.\\
Perhaps even stronger evidence that the \(FRN_{diff}\) and \(LPP_{diff}\) were related to different maladaptive learning strategies, however, is the finding that under ST, a more negative-going \(FRN_{diff}\) was associated with a smaller positive-going \(LPP_{diff}\). Thus, ST did not simply increase all aspects of emotional processing of negative feedback uniformly Rather, it was those individuals who demonstrated the largest initial response to the negative feedback who appear to have been the most motivated to disengage further attention from either this information, as indicated by their smaller \(LPP_{diff}\), or any other reminders of their poor performance on that problem.\\
In contrast to the effects of the response to negative feedback on learning under ST, the only significant predictor of error correction under NT was the quantity of exploration within the tutor. This suggests that whatever parts of the tutor students in this condition opted to explore were encoded deeply, without the interference experienced by students in the ST condition. Furthermore, when these students opted to withdraw `earlier' from the tutor it did not appear to be negatively related to their emotional response to the error, at least as measured by the ERPs of interest.\\
We note that Math SAT was unrelated to learning success under NT conditions, but was the best predictor of outcome under ST. In the presence of ST, better Math SAT scores were also associated with less tutor use.

Our main finding was that the paths to this successful learning differed as a function of ST, with threat increasing the dependence between females' emotional response to negative performance feedback and their error correction success. Specifically, females who demonstrated evidence of enhanced initial detection of negative outcomes, perhaps stemming from greater overall vigilance for ability-impugning information, disengaged earliest from their exploration of subsequent learning opportunities, whereas those who demonstrated poorer regulation of their attention to and arousal from the negative feedback failed to receive significant learning benefits from any tutorial information they may have explored. Neutralizing threat not only liberated learning from dependence on these emotional responses, but also from prior measures of ability, leaving learning success to be determined by other factors, such as intrinsic motivation to investigate new approached to math problems, which may have been rooted in higher identification with the math domain.\\
These results are boradly consistent with recent fMRI findings that females' threat-induced performance deficits on math-relevant tasks are related to increased activity in neural regions associated with emotional conflice and its regulation, including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex.\\
Importantly, however, we demonstrate for the first time that these emotional responses can disrupt not only initial performance but also learning. These findings also lend support to general feedback theories that model negative feedback as harmful rather than helpful to learning if it directs attention away from the task and toward processing of the individual's affective experience.\\
In addition our findings begin to unpack the different mechanisms by which emotion might impact learning under ST.
