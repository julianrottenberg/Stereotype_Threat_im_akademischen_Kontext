## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

Main aim: whether sex differences in neural efficiency could be attributed to the stereotype threat effect.  
Stereotype threat may affect brain activation differentially in women according to their individual level of intellectual ability. It can be hypothesized that high IQ women (who sense the task easier than low IQ women generally show lower brain activation according to the neural efficiency hypothesis) confronted with the stereotype show increased brain activation because they feel challenged to disprove this stereotype. Low IQ women may also strive to disprove the stereotype, but their already high level of arousal (due to their perception of increased task difficulty) may limit a further increase of activation.  
Therefore, this study aims at testing whether stereotype threat is partly responsible for sex differences in neural efficiency

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  
- [ ] No prospective allocation but use of pre-existing differences to create comparison groups (e.g. receiving different interventions, or characterised by different levels of a variable such as social class)  
- [ ] Other (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### How do the groups differ?

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] Explicityly stated (please specify)  
- [x] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

One group is exposed to stereotype threat, the other is not

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One  
- [x] Two  
- [ ] Three  
- [ ] Four or more (please specify)

- [ ] Not applicate (no prospective allocation)  
- [ ] Random  
- [x] Quasi-random  
- [ ] Non-random  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

Participants were IQ-matched between experimental groups in order to avoid confounding.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

### Please describe the main types of data collected and specify if they were used (a) to define the sample; (b) to measure aspects of the sample as findings of the study?

- [ ] Details

Shepard-Metzler (SM) figures -> b: Figures have to be rotated mentally until the main axis points in the same direction, before it can be decided whether teh pair of figures is identical or not (i.e., mirror images).

EEG -> b: measured by gold electrodes with 9 mm in diameter. Thirty-three electrodes were placed according to the international 10 - 20 system. A ground electrode was placed on the forehead, a reference electrode on the tip of the nose. EEG impendances were kept below 5 $k\Omega$. All signals were sampled at a frequency of 512 Hz. During recording a bandpass (0.1 - 100 Hz) as well as a 50 Hz notch-filter in order to avoid power line contaminations, were applied.  
The raw EEG was corrected for ocular artefacts by means of a regression-based algorithm using the softwair Brain Vision Analyzer (1.05). Remaining artefacts were removed by visual inspection. Further analysis steps were performed by means of a set of Matlab scripts (R2011b). The bandpower of the EEG ($\mu$V2) was computed by means of a time-frequency analysis employing a Fast Fourier-transformation (FFT) with a window size of 1000 ms and an overlap of 900 ms. For each trail the EEG band power in the upper alpha band (10 - 12 Hz) was computed as this alpha frequency band is particularly sensitive to task- and ability related effects. Changes in cortical activation were quantified by means of task-related power (TRP) changes between reference and activation phases for each electrode and trail.  

EOG (electrooculogram) -> b: to measure eye movements, recording bipolarly between two diagnonally placed electrodes above and below the inner and outer canthus of the right eye.

**Behavioural results**:  
average response time: 4.02 s (SD = 0.78)
Neither significant group mean differences for SEX (F(1,54) = 1.20, p = .28), nor for the STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE condition (F(1,54) = .05, p = .82); the two-way interaction was also not significant (SEX * STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE: F(1,54) = .01, p = .95; no-stereotype exposure condition: M_{girls} = 4.04, SD_{girls} = 0.91; M_{boys} = 4.04, SD_{boys} = 0.84; stereotype exposure condition: M_{girls} = 3.86, SD_{girls} = 0.79; M_{boys} = 4.11, SD_{boys} = 0.63)

Analysis of solution rates: There were neither significant group mean differences for SEX (F(1,54) = 2.94, p = .09, partial $\eta^2$ = .05), nor for the STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE condition (F(1,54) = 0.15, p = .70, partial $\eta^2$ = .00)  

The interaction of SEX * STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE remained insignificant (F(1,54) = 2.43, p = .12, partial $\eta^2$ = .04); no-stereotype exposure condition: M_{girls} = 36.92, SD_{girls} = 5.55; M_{boys} = 37.12, SD_{boys} = 5.43; stereotype exposure condition: M_{girls} = 34.46, SD_{girls} = 4.68; M_{boys} = 38.60, SD_{boys} = 4.36; see Fig. 2)

**EEG results**:  
First step, analysed the effect of stereotype exposure and sex on task-related power (TRP) changes in the upper alpha band. Four-way ANOVA, where STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE and SEX were treated as between-subjects factors, and HEMISPHERE and AREA were considered as within-subjects factors. A main effect of STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE (F(1,54) = 3.93, p = .05, partial $\eta^2$ = .07) indicated that participants working in the stereotype exposure condition showed higher cortical activation (M = 0.07, SD = 0.03) than participants working in the no-stereotype exposure condition (M = -0.03, SD = 0.03). No further TRP effects reached statistical significance.  

Then analyzed the ffect of stereotype exposure and sex on neural efficiency. In line with previous studies, the correlation between figural intelligence and brain activation (TRP) during performance of the mental rotation task was used as an inverse indicator of neural efficiency (i.e., a negative correlation would support the neural efficiency hypothesis). Correlations were computed separetely for each experimental condition (factors STEREOTYPE EXPOSURE and SEX) and each topographic area of both hemispheres. The TRP was normally distributed in each topographic area for all groups.  

Fig. 3: the IQ-brain activation relationship differs considerably depending on sex and stereotype exposure condition. In the no-stereotype exposure condition, boys showed the expected negative IQ-brain activation relationships especially at centroparietal (r = -.45, p = .05) and temporal areas (r = -.50, p = .04) of the left hemisphere. Girls working under the no-stereotype exposure condition rather tended to show a positive IQ-brain activation relationship especially in frontal areas (r = .48, p = .10) in the right hemisphere of the brain. In the stereotype exposure condition, no significant IQ-brain activation correlations were found, neither for boys nor girls. To sum up, in the no-stereotype exposure condition the neural efficiency hypothesis is supported only for boys, but not for girls. In the stereotype exposure condition no support for the nerual efficiency hypothesis was obtained, neither for girls nor boys.


### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [ ] Yes

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No

Methods on how the data was obtained are not described in detail  
It is implied that more was asked of the participants than reported by the exclusion of 5 participants due to EEG artifacts or because they disagreed to one of the two following statements: (1) "I am good at math" and (2) "It is important to me that I am good at math". Maybe there were more questions in the questionnaire that are not mentioned in the methods part of the paper.  
Did not always specify which calculations were performed, why and how.

## Quality of the study - Methods and data

### Are there ethical concerns about the way the study was done?
*Consider consent, funding, privacy, etc.*

- [ ] Yes, some concerns (please specify)
- [x] No concerns

### Were students and/or parents appropriately involved in the design or conduct of the study?

*e.g. (1) In an evaluation, was the process by which participants were allocated to or otherwise received the factor being evaluated concealed and not predictable in advance? If not, were sufficient substitute procedures employed with adequate rigour to rule out any alternative explanations of the findings which arise as a result? e.g. (2) Was the attrition rate low and if applicable similar between different groups?*

- [ ] A lot (please specify)
- [ ] A little (please specify)
- [ ] Not at all (please specify)

### How generalisable are the study results?

- [ ] Details

Not that much, the participants were adolescents from Austria, there has been no further information on the sample. In regards to stereotypes the ethnicity of the participants is relevant, since this is not mentioned here it is unclear how generalizable the results are. Furthermore, the researchers did not mention whether "women being bad at math" is a generally accepted stereotype in Austria. There is some research indicating that it is not necessary for the target to be aware of a stereotype to suffer under stereotype threat but it would still be interesting to know if the stereotype is generally accepted in Austria. In addition, we do not have any information about the socio-economic background of the participants, which is relevant for generalizability. 

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?
*In some studies it is difficult to distinguish between the findings of the study and the conclusions. In those cases please code the trustworthiness of this combined results/conclusion.** Please remember to complete the weight of evidence questions B-D which are in your review specific data extraction guidelines. ***

- [ ] High trustworthiness (please specify)
- [x] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Low trustworthiness (please specify)

The authors acknowledge that their results provide preliminary evidence, they also mention different approaches further research can take to gather more evidence. It is good however, that they mentioned results that do not support their hypothesis.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [ ] Not applicable (results and conclusions inseparable)
- [ ] High trustworthiness
- [x] Medium trustworthiness
- [ ] Low trustworthiness
