The study focuses on the cognitive mechanisms underlying stereotype threat effects in mathematical problem solving, particularly how stereotype threat impacts working memory resources.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is women, specifically female college students.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 17 - 20  
- [x] 21 and over  

The participants were undergraduate students, so likely included both 17-20 year olds and those 21 and over.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States, at two Midwestern universities.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how stereotype threat affects women's performance on mathematical problem solving tasks, specifically modular arithmetic problems. It investigates the impact of stereotype threat on working memory resources, especially phonological aspects of working memory. The study also explores ways to mitigate stereotype threat effects and examines potential spillover effects to other cognitive tasks.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The main research questions are:
1. How does stereotype threat impact neural activation patterns and cognitive processes in mathematical problem solving?
2. What are the specific neural and cognitive mechanisms through which stereotype threat influences math performance?

The study tests several hypotheses across 5 experiments:
1. Stereotype threat will impair performance on math problems that rely heavily on working memory resources.
2. Stereotype threat will particularly impact problems that rely on phonological aspects of working memory.
3. Practicing math problems to automaticity will reduce stereotype threat effects.
4. Stereotype threat effects can spill over to subsequent tasks that rely on the same cognitive resources.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

Key variables measured include:
- Math problem accuracy 
- Math problem reaction times
- Working memory capacity
- Phonological working memory load
- Verbal and spatial working memory task performance
- Self-reported thoughts/worries under stereotype threat

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study used a cross-sectional design, examining participants at a single time point across multiple experiments.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Before and after  

In most experiments, baseline performance was measured before the stereotype threat manipulation, and then performance was measured again after the manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to stereotype threat or control conditions in several experiments.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed based on exposure to a stereotype threat manipulation (informing participants about gender differences in math performance) versus a control condition.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

Most experiments compared a stereotype threat group to a control group.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state whether allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Other than the stereotype threat manipulation, procedures appear to have been identical across groups.

### Study design summary 

This study used an experimental design across 5 experiments. Women were randomly assigned to stereotype threat or control conditions and completed mathematical problem solving tasks (modular arithmetic). Performance was compared between conditions. The study also examined working memory processes using dual-task paradigms and transfer effects to other cognitive tasks.

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

- [x] Details

Results are presented using a combination of in-text descriptions, tables of means and standard errors, and figures showing accuracy and reaction time data.

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

Key findings include:
1. Stereotype threat impaired performance on high-demand horizontal math problems but not low-demand or vertical problems.
2. Adding a phonological load impaired performance on horizontal but not vertical problems.
3. Extensively practicing math problems eliminated stereotype threat effects.
4. Stereotype threat effects spilled over to subsequent verbal (but not spatial) working memory tasks.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that stereotype threat impairs math performance by co-opting verbal working memory resources needed for problem solving. They argue that stereotype threat induces verbal worries that compete for phonological resources. The authors also conclude that practicing problems to automaticity can alleviate stereotype threat effects, and that these effects can spill over to other tasks relying on verbal working memory.

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A lot (please specify)

The study uses multiple experiments with converging methods to rule out alternative explanations. They use control conditions, counterbalancing, and within-subjects designs to control for potential confounds. However, the fixed order of baseline and experimental conditions in some experiments is a limitation.

### How generalisable are the study results?

- [x] Details

The results may generalize to women in academic settings, particularly in math-related domains. However, generalizability is limited by the use of a specific math task (modular arithmetic) and a sample of college students from Midwestern universities.

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [x] High trustworthiness

The authors provide thorough discussion of their findings, linking them to previous research and theory. They acknowledge limitations and provide multiple lines of evidence to support their conclusions.

### Weight of evidence - B: Appropriateness of research design and analysis for addressing the question, or sub-questions, of this specific systematic review.

- [x] High

The experimental design with manipulation of stereotype threat and working memory demands is highly appropriate for addressing the review questions about the impact of stereotype threat on neural activation patterns and cognitive processes in academic settings.

### Weight of evidence - C: Relevance of particular focus of the study (including conceptual focus, context, sample and measures) for addressing the question, or sub-questions, of this specific systematic review.

- [x] High

The study's focus on the cognitive mechanisms of stereotype threat in math problem solving is highly relevant to the review questions. The use of working memory measures and neural activation patterns (inferred from behavioral data) aligns well with the review's focus.

### Weight of evidence - D: Overall weight of evidence 

- [x] High

Considering the appropriate design, relevant focus, and rigorous methods, this study provides strong evidence for addressing the review questions, despite some limitations in sampling and generalizability.
