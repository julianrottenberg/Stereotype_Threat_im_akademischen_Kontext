The study was carried out in the United States, at Columbia University in New York.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how stereotype threat affects females' emotional responses to negative feedback on a math test, and how these emotional responses impact subsequent learning from tutorial information and performance on a retest. It uses ERP measures to assess emotional processing of feedback.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The main research questions are:
1) How does stereotype threat influence females' emotional responses to negative feedback?
2) Do these emotional responses predict: (i) use of tutorial information (engagement with learning) and (ii) ability to correct errors on a retest (success in learning)?

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

Key variables measured include:
- Math performance (first test and retest accuracy)
- ERP responses to feedback (FRN, P3a, LPP)
- Tutorial use (engagement and depth of exploration)
- Learning success (error correction on retest)

### Study timing

- [x] Prospective  

The study took place over three days, with initial measures, the math test and ERP recording on day 2, and a surprise retest on day 3.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Before and after  

Math performance was measured before (first test) and after (retest) the stereotype threat manipulation and tutorial intervention.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were allocated to either a stereotype threat or non-threat condition.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in the instructions given before the math test. The stereotype threat group received instructions emphasizing evaluation of math ability and gender comparisons, while the non-threat group received instructions minimizing these aspects.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

Stereotype threat and non-threat groups.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state whether assignment to conditions was randomized.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not provide information on allocation concealment.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Both groups completed the same math test, received the same feedback, and had access to the same tutorial information.

### Study design summary 

This was a prospective experimental study comparing two groups: females under stereotype threat or non-threat conditions. Participants completed a challenging math test while EEG was recorded, received accuracy feedback after each problem, and had access to tutorial information. A surprise retest was given 24 hours later. The study examined how stereotype threat affected emotional responses to feedback (measured via ERPs) and how these responses related to tutorial use and learning success.
