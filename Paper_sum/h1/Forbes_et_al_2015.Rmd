## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

In this research, we were particularly interested in these negative subjective appraisals of performance under stereotype threat. If stereotype threat promotes greater vigilance to performance errors and a more negative interpretation of performance as reviewed above, the even in circumstances where performance is not acutally impaired, one's subjective appraisal and memory of performance might still be negatively biased.  
Our question was whether there are also individual differences in connectivity between neural networks implicated in selforiented processes that moderate the effect of stereotype threat on performance perceptions.

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  
- [ ] Implicit (please specify)  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

EEG measurements, time frequency analyses, source localization
probabilistic learning task (Frank et al., 2004), consists of a learning phase and a testing phase. results here were not relevant to the purpose of this study  
Primary outcome variables were participants' subjective reports of their performance included in a final questionnaire -> post-task error estimation, post-task doubt (and manipulation check).

### Study timing
*Please indicate all that apply and give further details where possible.*

*If the study examines one or more samples, but each at only one point in time it is cross-sectional.*  
*If the study examines the same samples, but as they have changed over time, it is retrospective, provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking backwards over time.*  
*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?
*If at least one of the outcome variables is measured both before and after the intervention, please use the before and after category.*

Ethnic minority and white participants

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One  
- [x] Two

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

behavioural analyses: independent samples t-test was conducted on participants' learning performance (total number of wrong trails), error estimations, doubt and the stereotype threat manipulation check

error estimates and self-doubt: error estimates and correlation analyses

time-frequency analyses: DMN synchrony was indexed by calculating mean phase-locking values between LLPC-P/PCC and LLPC-MPFC over 400 ms epochs in theta and alpha frequency bands at rest during the learning task.

phase-locking during the learning task: separate regression models were conducted to test whether error estimations, self-doubt, or learning were predicted by DMN phase-locking to wrong and correct feedback during the learning task. 

Error estimation: To determine whether phase locking between DMN regions at rest predicted error estimations for whites and minorities, we conducted a moderated regression analyses in which error estimations were regressed on dummy coded ethnicity (minority = 0, white = 1), mean-centered phase-locking within the DMN, and the interaction terms between ethnicity and phase-locking variables.  
We conducted separate regression analyses to independetnly examine alpha and theta phase-locking between LLPC-MPFC and LLPC-P/PCC. Initial analyses included gender and the requisite interaction terms in the model and yielded no significant main effects or interactions.  
Simple slopes analyses (Preacher et al., 2006) revealed that among minorities, greater LLPC-P/PCC theta phase-locking predicted less of a tendency to overestimate errors  

post-task self-doubt: repeated the aforementioned analyses.

Table 1, Fig. 2  

Behavioural analyses: These analyses revealed that minorities and whites exhibited comparable learning rates, degree of error overestimation and ratings of self-doubt, all Ps > 0.05, see Table 1. Compared with whites (M = 3.60, s.d. = 0.77), however, minorities (M = 3.08, s.d. = 1.11) were more likely to assume the researcher expected minorities to do worse on the supposed intelligence test than whites, t(86) = -2.48, P < 0.02.  

Error estimates and self-doubt: Consistent with past findings suggesting negative performance perceptions are internalized by stigmatized individuals under stereotype threat (e.g. Cadinu et al., 2005), error estimates were related to selfdoubt among minorities, but not whites (Table 1): Minorities reported greater self-doubt to the extent they overestimated the number of errors made on the supposed intelligence task. These correlations were not, however, significantly different from one another (P = 0.20).  

Error estimation: For both whites and minorities, error estimations were unrelated to LLPC–P/PCC phase-locking in the alpha band and LLPC–MPFC phase-locking in the alpha or theta bands, Ps > 0.30. A different pattern emerged, however, when examining the relationship between LLPC-P/ PCC phase locking in the theta band and error estimation. Whereas ethnicity was unrelated to the tendency to overestimate errors (P ¼ 0.957), a main effect emerged for LLPC–P/PCC theta phase-locking, b =-195.29, $\beta$ =-0.37, SE = 81.13, P = 0.021, which was qualified by a significant interaction, b = 350.13, $\beta$ = 0.37, SE = 147.26, P = 0.021 (Figure 2).2 Simple slopes analyses (Preacher et al., 2006) revealed that among minorities, greater LLPC-P/PCC theta phase-locking predicted less of a tendency to overestimate errors, b =-195.29, SE = 82.13, P = 0.021, whereas LLPC–P/PCC phase-locking was not related to error estimation for whites (b = 0.15, SE = 122.24, P = 0.210). Furthermore, among participants lower in LLPC–P/PCC theta phase-locking, minorities reported marginally greater overestimates of their errors than did whites, b =-27.39, SE = 15.80, P = 0.088. Among those higher in LLPC–P/PCC theta phase-locking, minorities reported marginally smaller, more accurate error estimates than did whites, b = 28.63, SE = 16.85, P = 0.095.

Post-task self-doubt: No effects emerged when examining phase-locking between LLPC–P/PCC in the alpha or theta bands, Ps > 0.40. However, phase-locking between LLPC–MPFC predicted decreased doubt, regardless of ethnicity. The relationship between LLPC–MPFC phase-locking and doubt emerged in both the theta band, b =-4.41, $\beta$ =-0.09, SE = 1.95, P = 0.028, and alpha band, b =-3.79, $\beta$ =-0.12, SE = 1.28, P = 0.005 (Figure 3). Though the interactions between ethnicity and LLPC–MPFC phase-locking were not significant Ps > 0.20, LLPC–MPFC theta phase-locking and self-doubt was significantly correlated among minorities (r =-0.54, P < 0.01) but not whites (r =-0.04; see Table 1), and a Fisher r-to-z transformation test on these correlation coefficients indicated that the relationship between these variables was significantly greater among minorities compared with whites, z =-2.0, P < 0.05 (two-tailed). No other effects were significant. Overall, the pattern of correlations and findings converge to suggest that DMN phase-locking was associated with performance perceptions and self-doubt for stereotype threatened minorities but not whites.

- [ ] Details

Findings from this study suggest that individual differences in spontaneous phase-locking between DMN regions at rest were associated with stereotype threatened minorities' self and performance perceptions.  
Although we observed no overall differences between minority and whites' self-perception (or implicit learning) on the task, minorities with lower levels of spontanous phase-locking in DMN regions during the initial rest phase tended to overestimate the number of errors they made on the supposed intelligence test (LPC-P/PCC phase-locking in the theta band) and reported greater self-doubt (LPC-MPFC phase-locking in both the alpha and theta bands) compared with whites (the latter pattern was less robust, however).  
The effect of phase-locking between DMN regions was unique to post-performance self-perceptions, as no relationships were found between spontaneous resting state DMN phase-locking and implicit learning performance among minorities or whites. This suggests that DMN connectivity might be more relevant to self-evaluation or appraisals of implicit learning processes than to learnig the probabilistic relationships themselves.  
These findings suggest a possible biological marker for individual differences in stereotype threat vulnerability: spontaneous fluctuations in phase-locking or neural synchrony, betwee nreions integral for the DMN. With regard to current conceptiosn of DMN function, this suggests that stigmatized individuals' performance perceptions under stereotype threat might vary to the extent they can cope with and/or anticipate emotionally stressful situations.

They kinda are, but the sample is not representative of the general population.

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?
*In some studies it is difficult to distinguish between the findings of the study and the conclusions. In those cases please code the trustworthiness of this combined results/conclusion.** Please remember to complete the weight of evidence questions B-D which are in your review specific data extraction guidelines. ***

- [x] High trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Low trustworthiness (please specify)

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?
