### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

The main findings were:
1. Increased alpha power (both lower and upper bands) after stereotype threat exposure
2. No significant changes in behavioral performance (idea originality or fluency) after stereotype threat
3. No significant correlations between alpha power and behavioral measures

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?

## DOES THIS REVIEW ADDRESS A CLEAR QUESTION?

### Did the review address a clearly focussed issue?
- Was there enough information on:
  - The population studied
  - The intervention given
  - The outcomes considered
- [x] Yes

The study clearly defined the population (female engineering students), intervention (stereotype threat), and outcomes (EEG alpha power and creative thinking performance).

### Did the authors look for the appropriate sort of papers?
- The 'best sort of studies' would:
  - Address the review's question
  - Have an appropriate study design
- [x] Can't tell

This question is not applicable as this is a primary study, not a review.

## ARE THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW VALID?

### Do you think the important, relevant studies were included?
- Look for:
  - Which bibliographic databases were used
  - Follow up from reference lists
  - Personal contact with experts
  - Search for unpublished as well as published studies
  - Search for non-English language studies
- [x] Can't tell

This question is not applicable as this is a primary study, not a review.

### Did the review's authors do enough to assess the quality of the included studies?
- The authors need to consider the rigour of the studies they have identified. Lack of rigour may affect the studies results.
- [x] Can't tell

This question is not applicable as this is a primary study, not a review.

### If the results of the review have been combined, was it reasonable to do so?
- Consider whether:
  - The results were similar from study to study
  - The results of all the included studies are clearly displayed
  - The results of the different studies are similar
  - The reasons for any variations are discussed
- [x] Can't tell

This question is not applicable as this is a primary study, not a review.

## WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?

### What is the overall result of the review?
- Consider:
  - If you are clear about the review's 'bottom line' results
  - What these are (numerically if appropriate)
  - How were the results expressed (NNT, odds ratio, etc)

The main results of this primary study are:
1. Increased alpha power (both lower and upper bands) after stereotype threat exposure
2. No significant changes in behavioral performance (idea originality or fluency) after stereotype threat
3. No significant correlations between alpha power and behavioral measures

Results were expressed as F-statistics from ANOVAs and correlation coefficients.

### How precise are the results?
- Are the results presented with confidence intervals?
- [x] Yes

95% confidence intervals were reported for behavioral measures and some EEG results.

## WILL THE RESULTS HELP LOCALLY?

### Can the results be applied to the local population?
- Consider whether:
  - The patients covered by the review could be sufficiently different from your population to cause concern
  - Your local setting is likely to differ much from that of the review
- [x] Can't tell

The results might be applicable to female engineering students in similar cultural contexts, but more information about the sample and setting would be needed to determine local applicability.

### Were all important outcomes considered?
- [x] Yes

The study considered both neural (EEG alpha power) and behavioral (idea originality and fluency) outcomes related to creative thinking.

### Are the benefits worth the harms and costs?
- Even if this is not addressed by the review, what do you think?
- [x] Yes

The study involved minimal risk to participants and provides valuable insights into the effects of stereotype threat on creative thinking processes. The potential benefits of understanding these processes likely outweigh the costs of conducting the study.
