### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Specific focus of this data extraction (please specify)  

This extraction focuses on the aspects of the study related to neural activation patterns in response to errors, particularly the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) components, as relevant to hypothesis 1 of the preregistration.

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by prior research on stereotype threat, psychological disengagement, and neural correlates of error monitoring. Specifically, it builds on work examining how stigmatized individuals cope with negative stereotypes and feedback in academic domains through psychological disengagement (e.g. Major et al., 1998; Schmader et al., 2001). It also draws on neuroscience research on the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) components as indices of performance monitoring (e.g. Gehring et al., 1993; Falkenstein et al., 2000).

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant #1R01MH071749 to T.S.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### In Which country or countries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States (at the University of Arizona).

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how psychological disengagement (devaluing and discounting) relates to neural indices of error monitoring (ERN and Pe) when minority students complete a task described as either diagnostic or non-diagnostic of intelligence. It investigates how these factors influence early motivational (ERN) and later evaluative (Pe) stages of error processing.

### What are the study research questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The main hypotheses were:

1. Valuing academics would predict greater ERN amplitudes when the task was described as a measure of intelligence, reflecting more vigilant early stage error monitoring.

2. Discounting would predict greater Pe amplitudes to errors when the task was described as a measure of intelligence, reflecting later evaluation of errors as more threatening.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study aimed to measure:
- Psychological disengagement (devaluing and discounting)
- Neural indices of error monitoring (ERN and Pe amplitudes)
- Task performance (errors, post-error slowing)
- Self-reported task difficulty and self-doubt

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study measured variables at a single time point.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Before and after  

ERN and Pe were measured both before (baseline task) and after the diagnosticity manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to either a diagnostic of intelligence (DIQ) condition or a control condition.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in how the task was described. In the DIQ condition, the task was described as predictive of intelligence. In the control condition, it was described as a neutral pattern recognition task.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

There were two groups: DIQ condition and control condition.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to condition.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not explicitly state whether allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Both groups completed the same tasks, with only the description of the task differing between conditions.

### Study design summary 

This study used a between-subjects experimental design with random assignment to two conditions (DIQ vs control). All participants completed baseline and post-manipulation error monitoring tasks while EEG was recorded. The key manipulation was how the post-manipulation task was described (as diagnostic of intelligence or not).

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

- [x] Details

Results are presented through text descriptions, statistical test results, and figures showing interaction effects.

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

Key findings include:
1. Devaluing moderated diagnosticity effects on ERN amplitudes, with valuing predicting larger ERNs in the diagnostic condition.
2. Discounting moderated diagnosticity effects on Pe amplitudes, with an unexpected pattern of smaller Pes for discounters in the control condition.
3. Devaluing predicted fewer errors and more post-error slowing in the diagnostic condition.
4. Discounting predicted greater perceived difficulty and self-doubt in the diagnostic condition.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [x] No

Confidence intervals were not reported.

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

The data reporting appears comprehensive.

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors report on all key variables mentioned in their hypotheses and research questions.

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

- [x] No

Data storage information is not provided.

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that devaluing and discounting have distinct implications for performance monitoring processes. Devaluing relates to early-stage motivational processes (ERN), while discounting relates more to later evaluative processes (Pe) and subjective construals of the task. They suggest that valuing academics leads to heightened vigilance for errors under stereotype threat, while discounting may lead to greater subjective threat from errors.
