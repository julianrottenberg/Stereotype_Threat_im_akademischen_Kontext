- Effects of ST on RSDC under math ST.
- We speculated that the RSDC of brain regions related to the regulation of social emotions (e.g. the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) might be increased.
- Considering the roles of the hippocampus in the generation of stressful responses, we hypothesized that the RSDC of the hippocampus might be decreased under ST, which might make the individuals more prone to experience stress-based arousal.
- Except in this region, due to the self-relevant processes being increased by ST, we thought that the RSDC of the brain regions related to self-memory should be increased. Therefore, we further speculated that the RSDC of the brain regions, such as the right posterior parietal regions (PPC), related to the retrieval of episodic memory or autobiographical memory might be increased.

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)

*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

- ST manipulation: e.g. "women are abd at math across all cultures"
- Control group: scientific investigation about two fictitious mountain peaks
- Math problems: There were three numbers in each math problem. The subjects were asked to calculate whether the result of the subtraction of the first and second numbers could be divided by the third number, e.g.: whether the result of "(30 - 26) / 7 = ?" was an integer.
- Manipulation check: 7-point scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree), "I am worried that the experimenters will conclude that women are bad at math based on my performance."
- ST and Control material was verified with a different group of 112 female subjects of the same university (56 for each ST/control group). They read the ST or control materials, then completed 20 math problems.
- RS-fMRI scan, each included 242 scans with 484 s in duration.
- 20 math problems
- whole-brain RS-fMRI images were acquired from a Siemens 3T scanner (MAGENTOM Trio, a Tim system) with a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. For each subjest, 242 functional images were acquired. Additionally, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared, rapid gradient echo sequence.
- RS-fMRI images were pre-processes using statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8), a toolbox for Data Processing and Analysis for Brain Imaging (DPABI). DICOM data were converted to NIFTI images, first 10 images were discarded. All functional images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space of 3 x 3 x 3 mm voxel sized using the segmented data. Normalized images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm. 
- RSDC was calculated using DPABI. RSDC values of each region of interest (ROI) were extracted by using the "ROI Signal Extractor" of DPABI.

**Results of the Manipulation Check (MC)**:  
- MC score for the ST group was 4.52 (SD: 1.58), while the MC score for the control group was 3.47 (SD: 1.31). 
- Two-sample t-test analysis showed that the mean MC score for the ST group was significantly higher than that of the control group.  

**Results of RSDC Analysis**:  
*Mixed-Effect Analysis of the Binary Graph*:  
- Results of 2 (test) x 2 (ST) mixed-effect analysis for the binary graph shpwed that the main effect of the test was significant to the left hippocampus, middle cingulate gyrus (MCG), right cerebellum, and left precentral gyrus (PCG), while the interaction between the test and ST was significant in the left cerebellum anterior lobe, left hippocampus, left precuneus, and left MOC (see Figure 1, Table 2). 
- Brain regions that showed a significant main effect of the test, the results showed that the mean RSDC z-value only in MCG was higher for the ST groups relative to the control group. 
- Of those brain regions that had significant interactions, the mean RSDC z-value in the left cerebellum was lower for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG) was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the left precuneus was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the left MOG was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the right AG was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; and the mean RSDC z-value in the left hippocampus was lower for the ST group relative to the control group.
- The RSDC for these regions was not significantly correlated with the MC score (see Table 2).  

*Mixed-effect analysis of the weighted graph*:  
- The results of whole brain 2 (test) x 2 (ST) mixed-effect analysis for the weighted graph showed that the main effect of the test was significant in the left hippocampus, left MCG, right cerebellum, and left PCFG, while the interaction between the test and ST was significant in the left cerebellum anterior lobe, left precuneus, left MCG, right SPG, and right AG (see Figure 2, Table 2)
- For the brain regions that had a significant main effect of the test, the results showed that the mean RSDC z-value only in MCG was higher for the ST group relative to the control group.
- For the brain regions that had significant interactions, the mean RSDC z-value in the left cerebellum was lower for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the left precuneus was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the right SPG was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value wasin the left precuneus was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; the mean RSDC z-value in the left MOG was higher for the ST group relative to the control group; and the mean RSDC z-value in AG was higher for the ST group relative to the control group.
- However, the RSDC for these regions was not significantly correlated with the MC score (see table 3).  

*The modulating roles of ST in the relationships between RSDC and MC score*:  
- The interaction between ST and MC score was significant in the right anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and the right hippocampus/amygdala for the binary graph, while only the right hippocampus/amygdala showed significant results for the weighted graph (see figure 3)
- for the binary graph, the results showed that the interaction between ST and psot-test RSDC fo the right ATL was significant
- the sample slope test showed that the post-test RSDC for the ST group was negatively correlated with the MC score, while the post-test RSDC for the ST group was positively correlated with the MC score.
- The interaction between ST and post-test RSDC of the right hippocampus was significant
- The sample slope test showed that the post-test RSDC of the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with the MC score in the ST group, while the post-test RSC of the hippocampus was positively correlated with the MC score in the control group, see Figure 4
- For the weighted graph, the results showed that the interaction between ST and post-test RSDC of the right ATL was significant for the weighted graph.
- the sample slope test showed that the post-test RSDC for the ST group was negatively correlated with the MC score, while the post-test RSDC for the ST group was positively correlated with the MC score.
- The interaction between ST and post-test RSDC of the right hippocampus was significant
- The sample slope test showed that the post-test RSDC of the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with the MC score in the ST group, while the post-test RSDC of the hippocampus was positively correlated with the MC score in the control group, see Figure 4

- [ ] Details

Results showed that the RSDC decreased in the left MOG and left hippocampus, while the RSDC increased in the right MCG, right SPG, right AG, and left precuneus. Furthermore, the results also showed that the right ATL and right hippocampus were negatively correlated with the MC score in the ST group, while the right ATL and the right hippocampus were positively correlated with the MC score in the control group.  

We speculated that the increased RSDC in the left precuneus and MCG might reflect that some self-relevant thoughts are generated by retrieving autobiographical memory or episodic memory.  
The self-relevant processes under ST could also be reflected by the increased RSDC in the PPC.  
According to the results, the RSDC of the left hippocampus was decreased, and the RSDC of the right hippocampus was negatively correlated with the MC score under the ST condition. These results might reflect that the importance of the hippocampus in the brain networks was decreased by the ST condition, which might make individuals prone to exhibit stress-based arousal.  
According to the result, the RSDC of the right ATL was negatively correlated with the MC score in the ST group, while the RSDC of the rigth ATL was positively correlated with the MC score in the control group. These findings reflect that the relative importance of the brain regions related to social concepts is decreased under ST, especially for more threatened individuals. It is dangerous to increase the self-relevant processes related to ST and at the same time decrease the functions of social concepts. Doing so might make the indiviual more prone to be influenced by their stigmatized social identity and discount other beneficial social identities.  

**Conclusion**:  
We detected the effects of ST on brain network degree centrality by directly comparing the RSDC between ST and control groups. These findings expand the knowledge of the neural basis of ST. Specifically, the results suggest that ST decreases the imporance of brain regions related to social concepts and stress regulation in the whole brain networks and, at the same time, increases the importance of brain regions associated with self-relevant processes. 


*Limitations*:  
We acknowledge several limitations of the study. First, the performance of the math problem was not measured in an RS-fMRI study, and we did not confirm whether the altered RSDCs were related to underperformance under ST. Second, Steele and Aronson (1995) found that ST could lead to some self-concerning processes, such as self-doubts, self-validating the stereotype, and stereotype avoidance. Although we speculate that the altered RSDCs might be ralted to these mental processes, we could not provide direct evidence from them because behaviour related to these processes was not measured. Third, due to this evidence being exclusively from female math ST, future studies should verify whether these results generalize to other STs (e.g. racial ST or ST related to social status). Therefore, we suggest that a sophisticated experiment integrating behavioural, task, and RS-fMRI may be required to reveal the detailed mechanism of ST.
