This study addresses whether, and if so how, exposure to a stereotype threat impacts the neural and behavioural correlates of creative thinking in female engineering students.
In the present study, we used a population likely vulnerable to stereotype threat targeting creative thinking (undergraduate female engineering students) and asked them to perform two standard creative thinking tasks before and after exposure to a gender-related stereotype threat.
If stereotype threat negatively impacts the ability to perform creatively - either in number of ideas produced (fluency) or the quality of ideas themselves (originality), an alpha decrease might be expected. Alternatively, if stereotype threat is actually stirring rather than discouraging, then stereotype threat delivery might lead to an alpha power increase along with improvement in creative thinking efforts (either in idea fluency or originality). Finally, buildinging on prior work repoting increased alpha power is associated with more original ideas, we also correlated alpha power to the idea of originality and fluency and expected a positive association based on past work.

*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [x] Not applicable (not more than one group)

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

- [ ] Details

- idea originality did not differ between the post-threat and pre-threat conditions. The Pearson's product-moment correlation between idea originality and the pre-threat and post-threat conditions combined and openness to experience was positive but failed to reach statistical significance. Participants' score on the stereotype threat vulnerability scale did not correlate with the originality of ideas generated after the administration of stereotype threat.
- Idea fluency: The number of ideas did not differ between post-threat and pre-threat conditions. Participants' socre on the stereotype threat vulnerability scale did not correlate with the number of ideas generated after the administration of stereotype threat.  
*EEG*
- Sensory-level analysis: In the lower alpha range, the ANOVA revealed a main effect of threat, with greater alpha Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) after the administration of stereotype threat. The main effect of hemisphere showed greater alpha ERS in the right compared to the left hemisphere. An area-by-hemisphere interaction showed greater alpha ERS in the right vs. left frontocentral, centrotemporal, centroparietal, and parietal areas. The threat-by-block interaction was not significant, ruling out the possibility that alpha power increased as a function of time on task. Finally, we compared alpha power in thne block directly preceding (block 2) and directly following (block 3) the stereotype threat. This one-way ANOVA was significant, and showed an increase in alpha power in block 3 rather than block 2. This result demonstrates that alpha power increased after the administration of stereotype threat.  
In the upper range, the RM ANOVA showed a main effect of threat, with greater upper alpha ERS after the administration of stereotype threat. The main effect of hemisphere, showed a greater alpha ERS in the right compared to left hemisphere. An area-by-hemisphere interaction, showed greater alpha ERS in the right vs. left centrotemporal, centroparietal, and parietal areas. The threat-by-block interaction was significant. Before the stereotype threat, alpha ERS was somewhat greater in block 1 than in block 2. By contrast, after the stereotype threat, greater alpha ERS was observed in block 4 rather than block 3. Finally, a direct comparison of upper alpha power in the block directly preceding (block 2) and directly following (block 3) the stereotype threat was significant and showed an increase in alpha power in block 3 rather than block 2. This result supports the finding from lower alpha range, demonstrating an increase in alpha power directly after the stereotype threat. Other comparisons did not differ from chance.
- Correlational analyses: Participants' ideational fluency did not correlate with alpha power in pre-threat and post-threat conditions either in the lower alpha range, or the upper alpha range. In the same vein, idea originality did not correlate with alpha power in the pre-threat and post-threat conditions either in the lower alpha range, or in the upper alpha range.  
For the left posterior alpha IC, the ANOVA showed a main effect of threat in the lower alpha range, with greater alpha ERS in the post-threat than in the pre-threat condition. Similarly, the effect of threat was significant in the upper alpha range with greater alpha ERS in the post-threat than in the pre-threat condition.  
For the right posterior alpha IC, the ANOVA showed a main effect of threat in the lower alpha range, with greater alpha ERS in the administration of stereotype threat. In the upper alpha range, the main effect of threat only approached significance with slightly greater alpha ERS after the administration of stereotype threat.  
Finally, for the central posterior alpha IC, the ANOVA showed a main effect of threat in the lower alpha range, with greater alpha ERS after the administartion of stereotype threat. Likewise, the effect of threat was significant in the upper alpha range with greater alpha ERS after the administration of stereotype threat.

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?
*Please give details and refer to page numbers in the report of the study where necessary.*

- [ ] Details

The primary finding in terms of brain activity was that alpha power increased post-threat relative to pre-threat, in both upper and lower alpha frequency bands and across both sensor-level and independent component cluster-level analyses. The behavioural effects did not reach statistical significance but trended towards participants generating more ideas post-threat, with those ideas being less original than the pre-threat ideas had been.  
These results appear consistent with an interpretation that the stereotype threat manipulation stirred and motivated participants to try harder, leading to increased internal attention to focuso n the task as reflected on alpha power, but that this effort did not lend itself to better behavioural performance.

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Is there an adequate description of the sample used in the study and how the sample was identified and recruited?

## Quality of the study - Methods and data

### Are there ethical concerns about the way the study was done?
*Consider consent, funding, privacy, etc.*

- [ ] Yes, some concerns (please specify)
- [x] No concerns

### Were students and/or parents appropriately involved in the design or conduct of the study?

- [x] Yes, a lot (please specify)
- [ ] Yes, a little (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Is there sufficient justification for why the study was done the way it was?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?
*e.g. (1) In an evaluation, was the process by which participants were allocated to or otherwise received the factor being evaluated concealed and not predictable in advance? If not, were sufficient substitute procedures employed with adequate rigour to rule out any alternative explanations of the findings which arise as a result? e.g. (2) Was the attrition rate low and if applicable similar between different groups?*

- [ ] A lot (please specify)
- [x] A little (please specify)
- [ ] Not at all (please specify)

a comparison group that is unaffected by stereotype threat would've been nice. After all it could be possible that the results appear regardless of stereotype threat but instead due to the task at hand. Using a before and after is good but future research might also want to add a control group.

### How generalisable are the study results?

- [ ] Details

The population, female engineering students, is probably familiar with the stereotype that women are not as good as men in STEM fields, however them getting this far might also mean that they are less affected by the stereotype - maybe they developed better coping skills or more resilience. Women with fewer coping skills might not make it to the major and drop out before hand, alternative, the participants might be less affected by the stereotype because they made it to the major - similar how the stereotype "women are bad at math" can be less impactful if the parents encourage their daughters to pursue math.


### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?
*In some studies it is difficult to distinguish between the findings of the study and the conclusions. In those cases please code the trustworthiness of this combined results/conclusion.** Please remember to complete the weight of evidence questions B-D which are in your review specific data extraction guidelines. ***

- [x] High trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Low trustworthiness (please specify)

highly trustworth for this specific group but not very generalizable to other groups.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [ ] Not applicable (results and conclusions inseparable)
- [x] High trustworthiness
- [ ] Medium trustworthiness
- [ ] Low trustworthiness
