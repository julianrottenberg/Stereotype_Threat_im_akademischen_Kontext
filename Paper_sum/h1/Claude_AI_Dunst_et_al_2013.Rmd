- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)  

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by previous research on neural efficiency, stereotype threat, and sex differences in visuo-spatial tasks. It aimed to examine whether sex differences in neural efficiency during visuo-spatial tasks could be attributed to stereotype threat effects.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The research was supported by two Grants from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P19842 and P23914.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on neural efficiency, stereotype threat, and sex differences in visuo-spatial task performance.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is on adolescents aged 15-18 years.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 11 - 16  
- [x] 17 - 20  

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in Austria.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study is concerned with neural efficiency (IQ-brain activation relationship) during a mental rotation task, and how this relationship is affected by stereotype threat for males and females.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The main research question was to examine whether sex differences in neural efficiency could be attributed to stereotype threat effects. The hypothesis was that stereotype threat may affect brain activation differentially in women according to their individual level of intellectual ability, which could explain why neural efficiency in visuo-spatial tasks has only been found for men but not for women.

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

Results are presented in text form, with statistical test results, and visualized using figures (e.g., bar graphs for performance data and correlation maps for neural efficiency results).

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

1. No significant behavioral differences were found between groups in task performance.
2. Participants in the stereotype exposure condition showed higher cortical activation than those in the no-stereotype exposure condition.
3. Neural efficiency (negative IQ-brain activation correlation) was observed only for boys in the no-stereotype exposure condition, particularly in left centroparietal and temporal areas.
4. No neural efficiency was observed in the stereotype exposure condition for either boys or girls.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [x] No

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors reported on all variables specified in their aims, including task performance, brain activation, and the relationship between IQ and brain activation (neural efficiency).

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

- [x] No

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that stereotype threat itself cannot explain sex differences in neural efficiency in visuo-spatial tasks. They suggest that visuo-spatial sex differences in brain activation patterns may be caused by biological factors and long-term social factors rather than short-lived stressing effects of stereotype threat on performance.

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A little (please specify)

The study controlled for IQ differences between groups and used standardized procedures for data collection and analysis. However, the lack of counterbalancing for the stereotype exposure conditions and the absence of a manipulation check for stereotype threat may introduce some potential for bias.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness

The authors provide a reasonable interpretation of their findings, acknowledging some limitations and suggesting alternative explanations. However, some conclusions may be drawn more cautiously given the study's limitations.
