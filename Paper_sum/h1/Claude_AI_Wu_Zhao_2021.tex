\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  No concerns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Were students and/or parents appropriately involved in the design or conduct of the study?}\label{were-students-andor-parents-appropriately-involved-in-the-design-or-conduct-of-the-study}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  No (please specify)
\end{itemize}

There is no indication of student or parent involvement in the study design or conduct.

\subsubsection{Is there sufficient justification for why the study was done the way it was?}\label{is-there-sufficient-justification-for-why-the-study-was-done-the-way-it-was}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Yes (please specify)
\end{itemize}

The authors provide a rationale for using RS-fMRI to study stereotype threat effects on brain networks.

\subsubsection{Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?}\label{was-the-choice-of-research-design-appropriate-for-addressing-the-research-questions-posed}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Yes (please specify)
\end{itemize}

The randomized experimental design with pre- and post-test RS-fMRI scans is appropriate for examining the effects of stereotype threat on brain networks.

\subsubsection{To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?}\label{to-what-extent-are-the-research-design-and-methods-employed-able-to-rule-out-any-other-sources-of-errorbias-which-would-lead-to-alternative-explanations-for-the-findings-of-the-study}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  A little (please specify)
\end{itemize}

The study design controls for some potential confounds by using a randomized design and pre-test measures. However, the lack of behavioral performance measures and the single-blind design (experimenters not blinded) introduce potential sources of bias.

\subsubsection{How generalisable are the study results?}\label{how-generalisable-are-the-study-results}

The results may be generalizable to female university students in China experiencing math-related stereotype threat. However, generalizability to other populations, cultures, or types of stereotype threat is limited.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Medium trustworthiness (please specify)
\end{itemize}

The study uses appropriate methods for addressing the research questions and provides detailed analysis. However, there are some limitations in reporting (e.g., lack of recruitment details, confidence intervals) and potential sources of bias (e.g., experimenters not blinded) that reduce trustworthiness.

\subsubsection{Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?}\label{have-sufficient-attempts-been-made-to-justify-the-conclusions-drawn-from-the-findings-so-that-the-conclusions-are-trustworthy}

\subsection{DOES THIS REVIEW ADDRESS A CLEAR QUESTION?}\label{does-this-review-address-a-clear-question}

\subsubsection{Did the review address a clearly focussed issue?}\label{did-the-review-address-a-clearly-focussed-issue}

    The population studied
  \item
    The intervention given
  \item
    The outcomes considered
  \end{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Yes
\end{itemize}

The study clearly defines the population (female university students), intervention (stereotype threat induction), and outcomes (changes in resting-state degree centrality).

\subsubsection{Did the authors look for the appropriate sort of papers?}\label{did-the-authors-look-for-the-appropriate-sort-of-papers}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

  \item
    Have an appropriate study design
  \end{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Can't tell
\end{itemize}

This is not applicable as this is a primary study, not a review.

\subsection{WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?}\label{what-are-the-results}

\subsubsection{What is the overall result of the review?}\label{what-is-the-overall-result-of-the-review}

This is a primary study, not a review. The main results show changes in resting-state degree centrality in specific brain regions under stereotype threat conditions.

\subsubsection{How precise are the results?}\label{how-precise-are-the-results}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Can't tell
\end{itemize}

The authors report p-values and effect sizes, but do not provide confidence intervals, making it difficult to assess the precision of the results.

\subsection{WILL THE RESULTS HELP LOCALLY?}\label{will-the-results-help-locally}

\subsubsection{Can the results be applied to the local population?}\label{can-the-results-be-applied-to-the-local-population}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Can't tell
\end{itemize}

The applicability to local populations would depend on the similarity to the study sample (female university students in China).

\subsubsection{Were all important outcomes considered?}\label{were-all-important-outcomes-considered}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  No
\end{itemize}

The study did not include behavioral measures of math performance, which would have been relevant given the focus on math-related stereotype threat.

\subsubsection{Are the benefits worth the harms and costs?}\label{are-the-benefits-worth-the-harms-and-costs}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  Can't tell
\end{itemize}

The study does not discuss potential harms or costs associated with the research or its application.
