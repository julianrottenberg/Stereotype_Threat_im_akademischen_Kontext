- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study measured:
- Executive functions: inhibition, updating, shifting
- Math performance 
- Risk-taking behavior
- Stereotype threat manipulation check

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study used a cross-sectional design, measuring outcomes at a single time point.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Outcomes were measured only after the stereotype threat manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to either a stereotype threat condition or control condition.

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The stereotype threat group was told the study was investigating why women perform worse at math than men. The control group received no gender-related information.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

There were two experimental groups: stereotype threat and control.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not specify if allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Both groups completed the same tasks, with the only difference being the stereotype threat manipulation.

### Study design summary 

This was an experimental study using a between-subjects design. Female undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to either a stereotype threat or control condition. All participants then completed measures of executive functioning (inhibition, updating, shifting), followed by a math test and risk-taking task. The study examined how stereotype threat affected performance on these tasks and which executive functions mediated the effects.

## Results and Conclusions

### How are the results of the study presented?

- [x] Details

Results are presented in text and tables, with statistics reported for ANOVAs, t-tests, and mediation analyses. Path diagrams are used to illustrate mediation results.

### What are the results of the study as reported by authors?

- [x] Details

Key findings:
- Stereotype threat impaired women's math performance across experiments
- Stereotype threat reduced inhibition and updating, but not shifting
- Only updating mediated the effect of stereotype threat on math performance
- Inhibition mediated the effect of stereotype threat on risk-taking

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [x] Yes

95% confidence intervals were reported for the indirect effects in the mediation analyses.

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

The data appear to be reported thoroughly and appropriately.

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
