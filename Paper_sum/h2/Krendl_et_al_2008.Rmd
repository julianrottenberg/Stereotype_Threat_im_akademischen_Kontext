## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

It remains unclear how the mechanisms that are believed to underlie stereotype threat cause subsequent performance decrements. In order to effectively override the stereotype-threat phenomenon, it is vital to understand clearly the core processes that underlie it.  
In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the neural processes engaged when women perform difficult math tasks both in the present and in the absence of stereotype threat.  

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

*If the study examines the same samples as they have changed over time and if data are collected forward over time, it is prospective provided that the interest is in starting at one timepoint and looking forward in time.*  

- [x] Cross-sectional  
- [ ] Retrospective  
- [ ] Prospective  
- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?
*If at least one of the outcome variables is measured both before and after the intervention, please use the before and after category.*

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.
*Please give further details where possible.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)

They did only differ in their exposure to stereotype threat

### Number of groups
*For instance, in studies in which comparisons are made between groups, this may be the number of groups into which the dataset is divided for analysis (e.g. social class, or form size), or the number of groups allocated to, or receiving, an intervention.*

- [ ] Not applicable (not more than one group)  
- [ ] One

- [ ] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?
*Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the 'new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.*

**Behavioural Results**
*Overall Performance*: Performance (total number of math items answered correctly) was assessed in an ANOVA with time (Time 1 or Time 2) as within-subjects variable and condition (control or threat) as a between-subjects variable. The ANOVA revealed a significant interaction, and no main effect of time or condition.  
Subsequent t-tests indicated that the interaction emerged because the performance of control participants improved significantly over time, whereas the threatened group's performance decreased slightly over time.  

*Reaction Times*: The mean log reaction times for each participant were then analyzed in a mixed-model ANOVA patterned after the analysis of overall performance. This ANOVA revealed a main effect of time, and no interaction.  
Subsequent t-tests revealed that control participants' reaction times were significantly faster on the second math test than on the first. Participants in the threatened group, however, showed no significant difference in reaction time between the first and second tests. Reaction time was not associated with accuraccy.  

**fMRI Results**
From the imaging data, we identified neural activations that were greater during the second math test than the first. These analyses showed that the control participants recruited more left-lateralized activation in the inferior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area, BA, 47), let inferior parietal cortex (BA 40), and bilateral angular gyrus (BA 39) over time. By contrast, the threatened participants revealed greater activity in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC; BA 32/10) on the second test than on the first.  
In order to determine if there were functional dissociations between these ROIs, we conducted a 2 (condition: control or threat) x 2 (time: Time 1 or Time 2) ANOVA for each ROI identified in the preceding paragraph. Significant interactions emerged for BA 47, left BA 39, and right BA 39, there was also a trend for BA 40. Post-hoc statistical tests revealed that the two-way interactions emerged because control participants recruited BA 48, BA 40, and BA 39 to a greater extent over time, whereas threatened participants did not.  
A separate ANOVA conducted on vACC activation revealed a significant interaction, threatened participants, but not control participants, recruited heightened vACC activation over time.  
These findings suggest a functional dissociation between vACC and the other ROIs. To formally test for this functional dissociation, we computed additional ANOVAs that included region as a third factor. Specifically, we conducted 2 (time) x 2 (condition) x 2 (region: vACC vs. each cognitive region) mixed-model ANOVAs with time and region as within-subjects variables and condition as a between-subjects variable. In these analyses, functional dissociations between regions could occur because (a) the regions behaved differently across conditions (resulting in a Region x Condition interaction), (b) the regions behaved differently across time (causing a Region x Time interaction), or (c) the regions demonstrated different Condition x Time interactions (resulting in a three-way interaction.)  
We found a significant three-way interaction in each ANOVA - BA 47, left BA 40, left BA 39, right BA 39. The three-way interactions show that regions exhibiting a significant change in activation over time in one group of participants did not do so in the other group of participants.  
Together, these interactions revealed a double dissociation between cognitive regions (left inferior frontal, left parietal, and bilateral angular gyrus regions) and an affective region (vACC). Whereas left inferior frontal, left parietal, and bilateral angular gyrus regions demonstrated increased activity for control participants but not threatened participants over time, vACC demonstrated the reverse pattern (i.e., increased activity for threatened but not control participants over time).

- [ ] Details

The results obtained are consistent with predictions from stereotype-threat literature. Women who were reminded of the stereotype threat that there are sex differences in math ability underperformed on subsequent math problems compared with women who received no such remained. These behavioural differences were accompanied by robust differences in neural activity between the two conditions.  
Among women in the control condition, the brain regions that revealed heightened activation over time are consistent with the regions that previous imaging studies have identified as being associated with math computations, such as mathematical calculations, spatial representation of numbers, and mental rotation. These regions have been implicated in math learning.  
The predominantly left lateralization of neural activation over time in our control participants is also consistent with previous research suggesting that right-handed participants rely on left prefrontal areas (i.e., inferior and medial frontal gyri) to perform mental math tasks and left lateralized parietal cortex when they have begun to develop an expertise on specific math tasks.  
Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that participants in our control condition were developing strategies that enhanced their performance on the math task, as evidenced by their behavioural improvement over time.  
Women who received the stereotype-threat reminder, however, failed to show increased recruitment of these mathematical brain regions and also performed worse over time. Unlike the control condition, the threat condition was associated with robust activity in the vACC.  
Together, these findings shed light on the mental operations that underlie the pernicious effects of stereotype threat. Specifically, in the presence of stereotype threat, women experience heightened activation in the vACC, a region implicated in social and emotional processing, and subsequently fail to adopt effective mathematical learning strategies.  

With respect to the predominant theories about the mechanisms that give rise to streotype threat effects, our finding soffer two important insights: First, stereotype threat does not necessarily increase demands on working memory (as evidenced by the fact that neural regions that support working memory were no more active after the threat induction than before). Second, a primary neural consequence of stereotype threat is to increase activation in the vACC, a region involved in social and emotional processing. We certainly are not suggesting that working memory is unaffected by stereotype threat. Rather, the heightened vACC activation we observed may occur at the expense of successfully recruiting other neural networks, such as regions involved in mathematical learning or working memory, as suggested by Beilock et al. (2007).  

The primary effects of stereotype threat observed in this study may reflect several different psychological processes. For instance, stereotype threat may direct women's attention toward the negative social and emotional consequences of confirming negative stereotypes about their group, thereby increasing performance anxiety. Stereotype threat may also cause women to overmonitor their performance. Being reminded of negative stereotypes about their group may heighten women's awareness of their performance and limit the cognitive resources they devote to the task.

(Section B question 2) Was the study informed by or linked to an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research? (Section B question 3) Which of the following groups were consulted in working out the aims to be addressed in the study? (Section B question 4) Do the authors report how the study was funded? (Section B question 5) When was the study carried out? (Section B question 6)*

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Are the aims of the study clearly reported?
*Consider your answer to questions: What are the broad aims of the study? (Section B question 1) What are the study research questions and/or hypotheses? (Section C question 10)*

- [ ] Yes (please specify)
- [x] No (please specify)

The authors noted what they were looking into but never mentioned any hypothesis or research questions.  

### Is there an adequate description of the sample used in the study and how the sample was identified and recruited?
*Consider your answer to all questions in Methods on â€˜Sampling Strategyâ€™, â€˜Recruitment and Consentâ€™, and â€˜Actual Sampleâ€™.*

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [x] No (please specify)

- The age is missing as well as recruiting methods and the course they were taking. As @jonczykHowStereotypeThreat2022 noted, women majoring in fields that are mostly studied by men might be more resilient or have higher coping mechanisms, thus the course and age of the sample might actually end up being essential to know.  

### Is there an adequate description of the methods used in the study to collect data?
*Consider your answer to the following questions in Section I: Which methods were used to collect the data? Details of data collection methods or tools Who collected the data? Do the authors describe the setting where the data were collected? Are there other important features of the data collection procedures?*

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Is there an adequate description of the methods of data analysis?
*Consider your answer to the following questions in Section J: Which methods were used to analyse the data? What statistical methods, if any, were used in the analysis? Who carried out the data analysis?*

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

- However, how the results are being displayed in text is suboptimal and could be better for the reader.  

### Is the study replicable from this report?

- [ ] Yes (please specify)
- [x] No (please specify)

- Authors did not specify which math problems were used.  

### Do the authors avoid selective reporting bias?
*(e.g. do they report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?)*

- [ ] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

- can't say since they did not specifically mention what they wanted to look into or report  

## Quality of the study - Methods and data

### Are there ethical concerns about the way the study was done?
*Consider consent, funding, privacy, etc.*

- [x] Yes, some concerns (please specify)
- [ ] No concerns

- authors did not mention consent or the IRB approval  

### Were students and/or parents appropriately involved in the design or conduct of the study?

- [x] Yes, a lot (please specify)
- [ ] Yes, a little (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Is there sufficient justification for why the study was done the way it was?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?

- [x] Yes (please specify)
- [ ] No (please specify)

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?
*e.g. (1) In an evaluation, was the process by which participants were allocated to or otherwise received the factor being evaluated concealed and not predictable in advance? If not, were sufficient substitute procedures employed with adequate rigour to rule out any alternative explanations of the findings which arise as a result? e.g. (2) Was the attrition rate low and if applicable similar between different groups?*

- [ ] A lot (please specify)
- [x] A little (please specify)
- [ ] Not at all (please specify)

- see @jonczykHowStereotypeThreat2022 for examples of potential bias.  

### How generalisable are the study results?

- [ ] Details

- not very, the sample isn't too specific, however the authors did not provide enough, and relevant information about the participants.  

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?
*In some studies it is difficult to distinguish between the findings of the study and the conclusions. In those cases please code the trustworthiness of this combined results/conclusion.** Please remember to complete the weight of evidence questions B-D which are in your review specific data extraction guidelines. ***

- [x] High trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)
- [ ] Low trustworthiness (please specify)


### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [ ] Not applicable (results and conclusions inseparable)
- [ ] High trustworthiness
- [ ] Medium trustworthiness
- [x] Low trustworthiness

- The authors were very one-sided in their conclusions, and did not provide enough information to back up their claims.
