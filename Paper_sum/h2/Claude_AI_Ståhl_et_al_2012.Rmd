The key hypotheses are:
1. Stereotype threat facilitates immediate cognitive control under a prevention focus.
2. This effect is due to recruitment of cognitive control resources in response to threat.
3. Over time, stereotype threat leads to impaired cognitive performance under a prevention focus due to depletion of resources.
4. These effects do not occur under a promotion focus.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

Key variables measured:
- Stereotype threat (manipulated)
- Regulatory focus (manipulated and measured)  
- Cognitive control (measured via Stroop task)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Cognitive control and math performance were measured after the stereotype threat and regulatory focus manipulations.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not specify if allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Key results:
- Stereotype threat facilitated immediate cognitive control under prevention focus
- This effect did not occur under promotion focus
- Stereotype threat improved short-term math performance under prevention focus
- Stereotype threat impaired longer-term math performance under prevention focus
- No effects were found under promotion focus
