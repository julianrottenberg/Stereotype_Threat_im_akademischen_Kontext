### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how stereotype threat affects cognitive control and performance through regulatory focus. It looks at immediate and longer-term effects on cognitive control and math performance.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The key hypotheses are:
1. Stereotype threat facilitates immediate cognitive control under a prevention focus.
2. This effect is due to recruitment of cognitive control resources in response to threat.
3. Over time, stereotype threat leads to impaired cognitive performance under a prevention focus due to depletion of resources.
4. These effects do not occur under a promotion focus.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

Key variables measured:
- Stereotype threat (manipulated)
- Regulatory focus (manipulated and measured)  
- Cognitive control (measured via Stroop task)
- Math performance (measured via modular arithmetic task)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Cognitive control and math performance were measured after the stereotype threat and regulatory focus manipulations.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to stereotype threat vs control conditions and prevention vs promotion focus conditions.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

Groups differed based on the experimental manipulations of stereotype threat and regulatory focus.

- [x] Random  

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not specify if allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Key results:
- Stereotype threat facilitated immediate cognitive control under prevention focus
- This effect did not occur under promotion focus
- Stereotype threat improved short-term math performance under prevention focus
- Stereotype threat impaired longer-term math performance under prevention focus
- No effects were found under promotion focus
