The study was supported by Grants HA3285/4-1 and HI1496/1-1 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on how gender stereotypes and group sex composition affect cognitive sex differences in mental rotation, verbal fluency, and perceptual speed tasks. It also examines the potential role of testosterone as a mediator.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is adult men and women.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 21 and over

The mean age was 24.40 years for women and 25.56 years for men.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

The study included both male and female participants.

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution

Participants were recruited from the Department of Psychology at Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.

### In Which country or countries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study was carried out in Germany.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how activating gender stereotypes affects performance on cognitive tasks in mixed-sex versus same-sex groups. It looks at mental rotation, verbal fluency, and perceptual speed tasks. The study also measures testosterone levels to examine potential mediating effects.

### What are the study research questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study hypotheses were:
1. Activation of gender stereotypes will increase sex differences in all tasks.
2. Cognitive sex differences will be largest when gender stereotypes are activated in mixed-sex settings.
3. Enhanced cognitive performance after gender stereotype activation will be associated with increased testosterone levels, particularly in mixed-sex groups.
4. Testosterone levels will be correlated with cognitive performance, and cognitive performance will correlate with the strength of corresponding gender stereotypes.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study measured:
- Performance on mental rotation, verbal fluency, and perceptual speed tasks

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Before and after

Testosterone levels were measured before the gender stereotype manipulation and after cognitive testing. Cognitive tests were administered after the stereotype manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)

Participants were allocated to gender-stereotyped or control conditions, and to mixed-sex or same-sex testing groups.

### How do the groups differ?

The groups differed in:
1) Whether they received the gender stereotype activation or control questionnaire 
2) Whether they were tested in mixed-sex or same-sex groups

### Number of groups

There were 8 groups total: 2 (stereotype vs control) x 2 (mixed vs same sex) x 2 (male vs female)

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)

The paper does not explicitly state if assignment to conditions was randomized.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)

The paper does not provide information about concealment of allocation.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

### Study design summary 

This was a 2 (Sex) x 2 (Condition: Gender-Stereotyped vs. Control) x 2 (Group Sex Composition: Same- vs. Mixed-Sex) between-subjects experimental design. Participants completed cognitive tests after either a gender stereotype or control manipulation, in either same-sex or mixed-sex groups. Testosterone levels were measured before and after.

The authors provide a clear rationale for their study design, linking it to previous research and gaps in the literature on gender stereotypes, cognitive performance, and the role of testosterone.

### Was the choice of research design appropriate for addressing the research question(s) posed?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The 2x2x2 experimental design was appropriate for examining the effects of gender stereotyping and group composition on cognitive performance in men and women.

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A little (please specify)

The experimental design controls for some potential confounds, but there are limitations:
- The sample consists only of psychology students, limiting generalizability.
- The method of allocation to conditions is not specified, so potential selection bias cannot be ruled out.
- The study does not control for potential practice effects on the cognitive tests.

### How generalisable are the study results?

The results may be generalizable to young adult university students in Western countries. However, generalizability to other age groups, education levels, or cultures is limited.

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)

The study uses established measures and appropriate statistical analyses. However, there are some limitations in sampling and potential confounds that were not addressed, reducing the overall trustworthiness to medium.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness

The authors' conclusions generally follow from their findings, but some interpretations (e.g., implications for co-education) may be somewhat speculative given the limited sample and laboratory setting.
