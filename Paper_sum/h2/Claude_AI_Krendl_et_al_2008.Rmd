The study does not explicitly state research questions or hypotheses, but implicitly aims to identify the neural mechanisms associated with stereotype threat effects on women's math performance.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study explicitly measures math performance (accuracy and reaction time) and neural activation patterns using fMRI.

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional

The study examines participants at one time point, comparing performance and brain activity before and after an experimental manipulation.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Before and after

Math performance and brain activity were measured both before and after the stereotype threat manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)

Participants were randomly assigned to either a stereotype threat condition or a control condition.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)

The threat group was reminded of gender stereotypes about math ability, while the control group was not.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two

There was a stereotype threat group and a control group.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random

Participants were randomly assigned to conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)

The paper does not specify if allocation was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Both groups completed the same tasks, with only the stereotype threat manipulation differing between groups.

### Study design summary 

This was a randomized experimental study comparing a stereotype threat condition to a control condition. Female undergraduates completed math tasks while undergoing fMRI scanning. The threat group was reminded of gender stereotypes about math ability, while the control group was not. Math performance and neural activation were compared between groups and from pre- to post-manipulation.
