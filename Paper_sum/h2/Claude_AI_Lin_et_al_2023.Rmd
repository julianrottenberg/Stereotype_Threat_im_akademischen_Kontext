### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study is concerned with the effect of stereotype threat on females' spatial perspective-taking ability, and how this effect is mediated by executive functions, particularly inhibition. It involves manipulating stereotype threat and measuring its impact on spatial perspective-taking performance and executive function tasks.

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study hypotheses were:
1. Stereotype threat would impair females' spatial perspective-taking ability.
2. Stereotype threat would negatively affect executive functions, particularly inhibition and updating.
3. The effect of stereotype threat on spatial perspective-taking would be mediated by inhibition.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study explicitly measured:
1. Stereotype threat (manipulated as an independent variable)
2. Spatial perspective-taking ability (dependent variable)
3. Executive functions: inhibition, updating, and shifting (potential mediators)
4. Gender identification (covariate)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

The study examined participants at a single point in time, with no follow-up measurements.

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Measurements of spatial perspective-taking and executive functions were made after the stereotype threat manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to either a stereotype threat condition or a control condition.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in the information they received before the tasks. The stereotype threat group read a brief report stating that males have an advantage over females in spatial ability, while the control group read a neutral article about poplar trees.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two  

There were two groups: a stereotype threat group and a control group.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to either the stereotype threat or control condition.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The paper does not provide information on whether the allocation sequence was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

Apart from the stereotype threat manipulation, both groups underwent the same procedures and completed the same tasks.

### Study design summary 

This study used a between-subjects experimental design with random assignment to two conditions (stereotype threat vs. control). The independent variable was stereotype threat, manipulated through different texts read by participants. The main dependent variables were spatial perspective-taking performance and executive function measures. The study also examined the mediating role of executive functions, particularly inhibition, in the relationship between stereotype threat and spatial perspective-taking performance.
