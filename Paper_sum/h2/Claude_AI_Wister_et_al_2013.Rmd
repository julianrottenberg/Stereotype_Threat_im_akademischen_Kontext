### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)  

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by previous research on stereotype threat, particularly studies demonstrating its negative impact on cognitive ability tests among African Americans and women's performance on mathematics tests. It was also informed by research on menstrual attitudes and experiences, including studies showing persistent negative stereotypes about menstruation.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The authors do not report how the study was funded.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on whether mentioning menstruation serves as a stereotype threat that diminishes women's cognitive performance, and whether positive priming about menstruation can counteract this threat or enhance cognition.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is undergraduate women.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 17 - 20  
- [x] 21 and over  

The participants ranged in age from 18 to 29 years old.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Female only  

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study is concerned with:
1. Menstruation as a potential stereotype threat
2. The impact of mentioning menstruation on cognitive performance
3. The effect of positive priming about menstruation on cognitive performance
4. Women's attitudes towards menstruation as bothersome or debilitating
5. The relationship between closeness to menstruation and cognitive performance

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study had four main hypotheses:
1. Participants in the Menstruation Threat conditions would perform more poorly on cognitive tasks than women in the No Menstruation Threat conditions.
2. Positive priming would counteract the influence of the Menstruation Threat.
3. Women who thought menstruation was bothersome and/or debilitating, and those who specifically endorsed the belief that menstruation negatively impacted their cognitive performance, would not do as well on cognitive tasks compared to women who did not hold these beliefs.
4. Women in the Menstruation Threat conditions would perform more poorly on cognitive tasks than women in the No Menstruation Threat conditions, the closer they were to menstruating.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study aimed to measure:
1. Cognitive performance (using Stroop test and SAT-like math test)
2. Menstrual attitudes (using Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire)
3. Proximity to menstruation
4. Impact of menstruation threat and positive priming on cognitive performance

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional  

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after  

Cognitive performance was measured after the menstruation threat and/or positive prime interventions.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group (e.g. allocation to different interventions, or allocation to intervention and control groups)  

Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions based on the order of materials presented.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)  

The groups differed in the order of materials presented:
1. Menstruation Threat/No Positive Prime
2. Menstruation Threat/Positive Prime
3. Positive Prime/No Menstruation Threat
4. No Positive Prime/No Menstruation Threat

### Number of groups

- [x] Four or more (please specify)  

There were four groups.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The authors do not explicitly state whether the allocation sequence was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

All participants completed the same cognitive tasks and questionnaires, with only the order of presentation varying between groups.

### Study design summary 

This study used a 2 (Menstruation Threat/No Menstruation Threat) × 2 (Positive Prime/No Positive Prime) factorial design, yielding four conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of these conditions, which determined the order in which they received the menstruation history questionnaire (serving as the menstruation threat), positive prime information, and cognitive tasks. All participants completed the same cognitive tasks (Stroop test and SAT-like math test) and the Menstrual Attitudes Questionnaire.

5. In the Menstruation Threat/No Positive Prime condition, participants performed more poorly on the Stroop the closer they were to their next period.
6. In the No Menstruation Threat/Positive Prime condition, participants performed better on the Stroop the closer they were to their next period.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [x] No
   - [ ] Can't tell

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors report on all variables specified in their research questions, including the effects of menstruation threat and positive priming on cognitive performance, menstrual attitudes, and the relationship between proximity to menstruation and cognitive performance.

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

- [x] No

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that:
1. Mentioning menstruation can serve as a stereotype threat that diminishes cognitive performance, particularly on the Stroop test.
2. The positive prime used in this study did not counteract the effect of menstruation threat and may have intensified it.
3. Positive priming may moderate the relationship between closeness to menstruation and cognitive performance.
4. Further research is needed to investigate how negative assumptions about menstruation may influence women's functioning, attitudes, and experiences.

## Quality of the study - Reporting

### To what extent are the research design and methods employed able to rule out any other sources of error/bias which would lead to alternative explanations for the findings of the study?

- [x] A little (please specify)

The randomized design helps control for some sources of bias, but there are potential confounds (e.g., individual differences in menstrual experiences, prior exposure to menstrual education) that are not fully addressed.

### How generalisable are the study results?

- [x] Details

The results may be generalizable to undergraduate women in the United States, but caution should be exercised in extending these findings to other populations or cultural contexts.

### Weight of evidence - A: Taking account of all quality assessment issues, can the study findings be trusted in answering the study question(s)?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness (please specify)

The study has a clear design and uses established measures, but lacks some details about recruitment and has limitations in sample representativeness.

### Have sufficient attempts been made to justify the conclusions drawn from the findings so that the conclusions are trustworthy?

- [x] Medium trustworthiness

The authors discuss their findings in relation to their hypotheses and previous research, but some conclusions may be drawn too strongly given the limitations of the study.
