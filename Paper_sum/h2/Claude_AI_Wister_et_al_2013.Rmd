### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)  

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was informed by previous research on stereotype threat, particularly studies demonstrating its negative impact on cognitive ability tests among African Americans and women's performance on mathematics tests. It was also informed by research on menstrual attitudes and experiences, including studies showing persistent negative stereotypes about menstruation.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Not stated/unclear (please specify)  

The authors do not report how the study was funded.

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on whether mentioning menstruation serves as a stereotype threat that diminishes women's cognitive performance, and whether positive priming about menstruation can counteract this threat or enhance cognition.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is undergraduate women.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 17 - 20  
- [x] 21 and over  

The participants ranged in age from 18 to 29 years old.

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Female only  

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Higher education institution  

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study was carried out in the United States.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study is concerned with:
1. Menstruation as a potential stereotype threat
2. The impact of mentioning menstruation on cognitive performance
3. The effect of positive priming about menstruation on cognitive performance
4. Women's attitudes towards menstruation as bothersome or debilitating
5. The relationship between closeness to menstruation and cognitive performance

### What are the study reserach questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study had four main hypotheses:
1. Participants in the Menstruation Threat conditions would perform more poorly on cognitive tasks than women in the No Menstruation Threat conditions.
2. Positive priming would counteract the influence of the Menstruation Threat.
3. Women who thought menstruation was bothersome and/or debilitating, and those who specifically endorsed the belief that menstruation negatively impacted their cognitive performance, would not do as well on cognitive tasks compared to women who did not hold these beliefs.
4. Women in the Menstruation Threat conditions would perform more poorly on cognitive tasks than women in the No Menstruation Threat conditions, the closer they were to menstruating.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)  

The study aimed to measure:
1. Cognitive performance (using Stroop test and SAT-like math test)
2. Menstrual attitudes (using Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire)
3. Proximity to menstruation

4. No Positive Prime/No Menstruation Threat

### Number of groups

- [x] Four or more (please specify)  

There were four groups.

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random  

Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions.

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

### Study design summary 

This study used a 2 (Menstruation Threat/No Menstruation Threat) Ã— 2 (Positive Prime/No Positive Prime) factorial design, yielding four conditions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of these conditions, which determined the order in which they received the menstruation history questionnaire (serving as the menstruation threat), positive prime information, and cognitive tasks. All participants completed the same cognitive tasks (Stroop test and SAT-like math test) and the Menstrual Attitudes Questionnaire.

6. In the No Menstruation Threat/Positive Prime condition, participants performed better on the Stroop the closer they were to their next period.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - CONSIDER:
     - Were confidence intervals (CIs) reported?
   - [x] No
   - [ ] Can't tell

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

- [x] Yes (please specify)

The authors report on all variables specified in their research questions, including the effects of menstruation threat and positive priming on cognitive performance, menstrual attitudes, and the relationship between proximity to menstruation and cognitive performance.

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

- [x] No

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that:
