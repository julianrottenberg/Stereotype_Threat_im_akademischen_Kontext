  We hypothesized that gender stereotype threat impairs females' spatial perspective taking. That is to say, females who were primed by a negative stereotype threat would perform worse on a spatial perspective-taking task than those who were not primed with a stereotype threat.
\item
  We also aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of the effect of gender stereotype threat on females' spatial perspective-taking.
\item
  Combining the impact of stereotype threat on inhibition and the important role of inhibition in spatial perspective taking, we predicted that reduced inhibition may account for the effect of stereotype threat on females' spatial perspective-taking ability.

\emph{Bias can be introduced, consciously or otherwise, if the allocation of pupils or classes or schools to a programme or intervention is made in the knowledge of key characteristics of those allocated. For example: children with more serious reading difficulty might be seen as in greater need and might be more likely to be allocated to the `new' programme, or the opposite might happen. Either would introduce bias.}

\textbf{Experiment 1}:
- A total of 76 undergraduate students (mean age = 18.36 years, SD = 1.17) were randomly recruited as participants in return for ¥10.
- All participants were females (38 in the control condition and 38 in the stereotype threat condition)
- There was no significant difference in age between the stereotype threat group (M = 18.32, SD = 1.25) and the control group (M = 18.39, SD = 1.10)

\textbf{Experiment 2}:
- Eighty-four female undergraduate students participated in this study for ¥10.
- Seven participants were excluded from the analyses due to equipment malfunction (n = 1), not completing the perspective-taking test as required (n = 2), or extreme outliers on executive function measures (n = 4).
- The remaining 77 (mean age = 18.53, SD = 1.1.7) participants were included in the analyses
- There was no significant difference in age between the conditions.

\textbf{Experiment 1}:
- \emph{Gender Identification}: Independent t-test showed that there was no significant difference in gender identification between the stereotype threat and the control group. Thus activating the stereotype threat was not affected by participants' gender identification.
- \emph{Spatial Perspective-Taking Performance}: The degree of deviation from the correct direction (angular error) differed significantly between the stereotype threat condition and the control condition. The angular error was higher in the stereotype threat condition than in the control condition. A post-hoc power analysis using G*Power indicated that we were sufficiently powered to detect a medium-sized effect. This result suggested that females' performance on the perspective-taking task was undermined when stereotype threat was activated.

\textbf{Experiment 2}:
- \emph{Manipulation Check}: Independent t-test showed that the score of stereotype threat group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Therefore the manipulation of stereotype threat was effective in Experiment 2
- \emph{Gender Identification}: There was no significant difference in gender identification between the stereotype threat group and the control group.
- \emph{Inhibition}: There was a significant effect of stereotype threat on the inhibition task. Females under threat showed lower inhibition than females in the control condition, indicating that stereotype threat reduced the inhibition function. Post-hoc power = .92
- \emph{Updating}: The results for the updating task also showed a significant effect of stereotype threat. Females showed poorer updating performance in the stereotype threat condition than in the control condition, indicating that stereotype threat also negatively impacted the updating function. The post-hoc power analysis indicated that power was 0.66
- \emph{Shifting}: There was no significant effect of stereotype threat on shifting. Thus, the shifting function was not affected by stereotype threat.
- \emph{Spatial Perspective-Taking Performance}: Females in the stereotype threat condition showed higher angular deviation than females in the control condition. This suggests that the females' spatial perspective-taking performance was affected by stereotype threat. The results replicated the results obtained from Experiment 1. Post-hoc power = .97
- \emph{Correlations between Variables}: There was a significant positive correlation between the inhibition and spatial perspective-taking measures. The correlation between the shifting and the perspective-taking measures as well as the correlation between the updating and the perspective-taking measures were not significant. We also found that inhibition was correlated with updating but was not correlated with shifting. Updating was not correlated with shifting.
- \emph{Mediation Analysis}: The results showed that although stereotype threat was related to both the inhibition task and the updating task, only the mediation effect of the inhibition task on the relationship between stereotype threat and perspective taking was significant. The mediating effects of updating and shifting were not significant. We found that the direct effect of stereotype threat on the angular deviation of spatial perspective-taking test was statistically significant. Stereotype threat also had significant negative effects on both inhibition and updating, but no significant effect on shifting. Inhibition negatively predicted the angular deviation of the spatial perspective-taking test. The effects of updating and shifting on the spatial perspective-taking test were not significant. Stereotype threat not only directly affected females' spatial perspective-taking ability but also damaged it through the inhibition function.

\textbf{Experiment 1}:
Findings obtained from Experiment 1 were fully consistent with our prediction that females would perform worse on the spatial perspective-taking task in the stereotype threat condition. This revealed that stereotype threat had a negative effect on female perspective-taking ability.

\textbf{Experiment 2}:
The results of Experiment 2 verified the negative impact of stereotype threat on females' spatial perspective-taking, replicating the results obtained from Experiment 1. The results also showed that stereotype threat negatively impacted the inhibition and updating components of executive function. The results of the multiple mediation analysis indicated that inhibition mediated the relationship between stereotype threat and females' spatial perspective-taking. That is, the negative impact of stereotype threat on spatial perspective-taking ability was partically caused by reduced inhibition. In addition, stereotype threat decreased the updating ability, but neither updating nor shifting mediated the effect of stereotype threat. These findings further detailed the cognitive mechanism of the effect of stereotype threat on spatial perspective-taking performance.

\textbf{General Discussion}:
The current study explored the effect of stereotype threat on females' spatial perspective taking and identified a possible cognitive mechanism.\\
Our results showed that stereotype threat impaired females' spatial perspective taking. These results were consistent with previous research about the relationship between stereotype threat and other spatial abilities.
Our research on spatial perspective-taking is meaningful and enriches the research structure in the field of stereotype threat and spatial ability.

Our study found that stereotype threat impairs executive functions. Specifically, the inhibition and updating components of executive function were lower in the stereotype threat condition than in the control condition. In earlier studies, executive function has been treated as a single variable without consideration of its components or has been one-sidedly understood as inhibitory control. Executive function has both a unified and a diverse structure. Recent research has focused on the relationship between stereotype threat and different components of executive function. Consistent with our findings, previous studies have found that stereotype threat could cause a decline in inhibition function and the updating function proposed that stereotype threat led to poor performance via depleted executive resources.
The probable reason is that a negative stereotype threat leads to a reduction in self-regulation or an increase in negative emotion, resulting in a lowering of inhibition and updating. With respect to shifting, to our knowledge no research has shown that stereotype threat reduces the shifting function. Individuals might engage in a large amount of shifting to try to get out of the threat. Thus, shifting should not be impaired by stereotype threat.

It is worth noting that some researchers have been unable to replicate the effect of stereotype threat on the inhibitory control.

Although inhibition and updating were negatively affected by stereotype threat, only the decline in the inhibition function was related to the decline in females' spatial perspective-taking ability. Rydell et al.~(2014) suggested that the impact of stereotype threat on different outcomes may be mediated by different executive functions. Our experimental results support this perspective in that the impact of stereotype threat on spatial perspective-taking was not mediated by the entire set of executive functions.

\textbf{Conclusion}:
Overall, our results show that stereotype threat has a negative impact on females' performance in spatial perspective-taking ability. And the present study provides further evidence for the role of executive function. Specifically, stereotype threat reduced females' inhibition and updating function, rather than their shifting function. The inhibition function plays a mediating role in the relationship between stereotype threat and females' spatial perspective taking.
