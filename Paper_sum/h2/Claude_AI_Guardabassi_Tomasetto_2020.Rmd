### If the study has a broad focus and this data extraction focuses on just one component of the study, please specify this here
 
- [x] Not applicable (whole study is focus of data extraction)

## Study aim(s) and rationale

### Was the study informed by, or linked to, an existing body of empirical and/or theoretical research?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study was informed by existing research on stereotype threat, working memory deficits associated with obesity, and weight stigma in children. The authors cite multiple studies demonstrating associations between higher BMI and impaired executive functions, including working memory, in children. They also reference prior work on stereotype threat effects in other domains and populations.

### Do authors report how the study was funded?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The authors state: "This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors."

## Study research question(s) and its policy or practice focus

### What is/are the topic focus/foci of the study?

The study focuses on stereotype threat effects on working memory in children with excess weight. Specifically, it examines whether obesity stereotypes, rather than excess weight itself, contribute to working memory impairments in children.

### What is/are the population focus/foci of the study?

The population focus is primary school children, including those with obesity, overweight, and average weight.

### What is the relevant age group? 

- [x] 5 - 10
- [x] 11 - 16

The sample included children in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, with a mean age of 116.07 months (approximately 9.7 years).

### What is the sex of the population focus/foci?

- [x] Mixed sex

The sample included both boys (n=106) and girls (n=70).

### What is/are the educational setting(s) of the study?

- [x] Primary school

### In Which country or cuntries was the study carried out?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study was carried out in Italy.

### Please describe in more detail the specific phenomena, factors, services, or interventions with which the study is concerned

The study examines how stereotype threat affects working memory performance in children with varying BMI levels. It manipulates stereotype threat by framing a working memory task as either diagnostic of intelligence (stereotype-threatening condition) or as a non-diagnostic computer game (non-stereotype-threatening condition). The study also considers potential moderating effects of weight-based teasing experiences and personal endorsement of obesity stereotypes.

### What are the study research questions and/or hypotheses?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study has three main hypotheses:

H1: A negative association between BMI and working memory will emerge when working memory tasks are labeled as an assessment of stereotype-related cognitive abilities, compared to when they are labeled as non-diagnostic tools.

H2: Experiences of weight stigmatization will strengthen the negative relation between children's BMI and working memory under stereotype threat.

H3: Personal endorsement of the intelligence obesity stereotype will strengthen the negative relation between children's BMI and working memory under stereotype threat.

## Methods - Design

### Which variables or concepts, if any, does the study aim to measure or examine?

- [x] Explicitly stated (please specify)

The study measures:
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Working memory (using the N-back task)
- Weight-based teasing experiences (using the Perception of Teasing Scale)
- Personal endorsement of obesity stereotypes about intelligence
- Stereotype threat condition (manipulated)

### Study timing

- [x] Cross-sectional

### If the study is an evaluation, when were measurements of the variable(s) used for outcome made, in relation to the intervention?

- [x] Only after

Measurements were taken after the stereotype threat manipulation.

## Methods - Groups

### If comparisons are being made between two or more groups, please specify the basis of any divisions made for making these comparisons.

- [x] Prospecitive allocation into more than one group

Participants were randomly assigned to either a stereotype-threatening (ST) condition or a non-stereotype-threatening (NST) condition.

### How do the groups differ?

- [x] Explicityly stated (please specify)

The groups differed in how the working memory task was framed. In the ST condition, it was labeled as a test to assess intelligence. In the NST condition, it was labeled as a non-diagnostic computer game.

### Number of groups

- [x] Two

### Was the assignment of participants to interventions randomised?

- [x] Random

### Where there was prospective allocation to more than one group, was the allocation sequence concealed from participants and those enrolling them until after enrolment?

The paper does not provide information on whether the allocation sequence was concealed.

### Apart from the experimental intervention, did each study group receive the same level of care (that is, were they treated equally)?

- [x] Yes

### Study design summary 

This study used a cross-sectional, experimental design with random allocation to two groups (stereotype-threatening and non-stereotype-threatening conditions). The main outcome was working memory performance, measured using the N-back task. The study examined how BMI, stereotype threat condition, and their interaction affected working memory performance, as well as potential moderating effects of weight-based teasing experiences and personal endorsement of obesity stereotypes.

2. In the stereotype-threatening condition, working memory scores declined by 0.35 standard deviations per unit increase in children's BMI.
3. In the non-stereotype-threatening condition, there was no significant relation between BMI and working memory.
4. Contrary to hypotheses, neither weight-based stigma experiences nor endorsement of the obesity stereotype about intelligence moderated the BMI x condition interaction effect on working memory.

### Was the precision of the estimate of the intervention or treatment effect reported?
   - [x] No

### Are there any obvious shortcomings in the reporting of the data?

- [x] No

### Do the authors report on all variables they aimed to study as specified in their aims/research questions?

The authors report on all variables specified in their hypotheses, including BMI, working memory performance, stereotype threat condition, weight-based teasing experiences, and endorsement of obesity stereotypes.

### Do the authors state where the full original data are stored?

- [x] No

### What do the author(s) conclude about the findings of the study?

- [x] Details

The authors conclude that:
