  abstract = {The high prevalence of childhood obesity has drawn increasing attention to the neurocognitive impairments associated with excess weight, and evidence has accumulated of a progressive decline in working memory at increasing levels of children's Body Mass Index (BMI). However, obesity is also a highly stigmatizing condition, and pervasive societal stereotypes depict individuals with obesity as less intelligent than those with average weight. For this reason, we investigated whether stereotype threat (i.e., the fear of confirming a negative stereotype attached to one's social groups) contributes to working memory impairments in children with excess weight. By applying a consolidated paradigm in stereotype threat research, primary school-age children (N=176) performed a computerized working memory task that was alternatively labeled as diagnostic (i.e., stereotype-threatening) or nondiagnostic (i.e., non-stereotype-threatening) of their intellectual ability. Results confirmed that working memory decreased at increasing levels of BMI in the stereotype-threatening condition, whereas the relation between body weight and working memory was null when task diagnosticity was removed. This effect was not further moderated by children's direct experiences of weight-based stigmatization or by their personal endorsement of the obesity stereotype about intelligence. These findings suggest that vulnerability to weight-related stereotype threat emerges early in life and may contribute to working memory deficits in children with obesity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Sex differences in specific cognitive abilities are well documented, but the biological, psychological, and sociocultural interactions that may underlie these differences are largely unknown. We examined within a biopsychosocial approach how gender stereotypes affect cognitive sex differences when adult participants were tested in mixed-or same-sex groups. A total of 136 participants (70 women) were allocated to either mixed-or same-sex groups and completed a battery of sex-sensitive cognitive tests (i.e., mental rotation, verbal fluency, perceptual speed) after gender stereotypes or gender-neutral stereotypes (control) were activated. To study the potential role of testosterone as a mediator for group sex composition and stereotype boost/threat effects, saliva samples were taken before the stereotype manipulation and after cognitive testing. The results showed the typical male and female advantages in mental rotation and verbal fluency, respectively. In general, men and women who were tested in mixed-sex groups and whose gender stereotypes had not been activated performed best. Moreover, a stereotype threat effect emerged in verbal fluency with reduced performance in gender stereotyped men but not women. Testosterone levels did not mediate the effects of group sex composition and stereotype threat nor did we find any relationship between testosterone and cognitive performance in men and women. Taken together, the findings suggest that an interaction of gender stereotyping and group sex composition affects the performance of men and women in sex-sensitive cognitive tasks. Mixed-sex settings can, in fact, increase cognitive performance as long as gender-stereotyping is prevented.},

In each experiment, sixty female participants completed an operation span task (OSPAN) containing thought content probes. The task was framed as a math task for those in a condition primed for math-related stereotype threat and as a memory task for those in a control condition. In both studies, women whose performance-related concerns were primed via stereotype threat reported more TRI than women in the control. The second experiment used a more challenging OSPAN task and stereotype primed women also had lower math accuracy than controls. These results support the "control failures x current concerns" framework of mind-wandering, which posits that the degree to which the environmental context triggers personal concerns influences both mind-wandering frequency and content.},

In this study, we examined whether stereotype threat negatively affects females' spatial perspective-taking ability and executive functions. Then we explored which components of executive function play a mediating role in the effect of stereotype threat on females' spatial perspective-taking ability. We carried out two experiments. In Experiment 1, female participants in a stereotype threat condition or a control condition completed a spatial perspective-taking test. The results showed that females' spatial perspective-taking ability was reduced by stereotype threat. In Experiment 2, female participants were again assigned to a stereotype threat condition or a control condition; then they were asked to complete tasks measuring three executive functions (inhibition, shifting, and updating), following which they completed the spatial perspective-taking test. Experiment 2 found that stereotype threat decreased inhibition, updating, and spatial perspective-taking performance. The results also showed that only inhibition accounted for the effect of stereotype threat on spatial perspective taking. To sum up, the results from the current study shed new light on the relationship between stereotype threat and spatial perspective-taking ability and explained the relationship from a more detailed perspective.},

Models of stereotype threat assert that threat reduces cognitive functioning, thereby accounting for its negative effects. This work provides a more detailed understanding of the cognitive processes through which stereotype threat leads women to underperform at math and to take risks, by examining which basic executive functions (inhibition, shifting, and updating) account for these outcomes. In Experiments 1 and 2, women under threat showed reduced inhibition, reduced updating, and reduced math performance compared with women in a control condition (or men); however, only updating accounted for women's poor math performance under threat. In Experiment 3, only updating accounted for stereotype threat's effect on women's math performance, whereas only inhibition accounted for the effect of threat on risk-taking, suggesting that distinct executive functions can account for different stereotype threat--related outcomes.},

  abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that stereotype threat induces a prevention focus and impairs central executive functions. The present research examines how these 2 consequences of stereotype threat are related. The authors argue that the prevention focus is responsible for the effects of stereotype threat on executive functions and cognitive performance. However, because the prevention focus is adapted to deal with threatening situations, the authors propose that it also leads to some beneficial responses to stereotype threat. Specifically, because stereotype threat signals a high risk of failure, a prevention focus initiates immediate recruitment of cognitive control resources. The authors further argue that this response initially facilitates cognitive performance but that the additional cognitive demands associated with working under threat lead to cognitive depletion over time. Study 1 demonstrates that stereotype threat (vs. control) facilitates immediate cognitive control capacity during a stereotype-relevant task. Study 2 experimentally demonstrates the process by showing that stereotype threat (vs. control) facilitates cognitive control as a default, as well as when a prevention focus has been experimentally induced, but not when a promotion focus has been induced. Study 3 shows that stereotype threat facilitates initial math performance under a prevention focus, whereas no effect is found under a promotion focus. Consistent with previous research, however, stereotype threat impaired math performance over time under a prevention focus, but not under a promotion focus.},

  abstract = {To investigate menstruation as a stereotype threat that could have the effect of diminishing cognitive performance, 92 undergraduate women from a small, urban university in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (US) completed two cognitive tasks, a Stroop test, and an SAT-based mathematics test, as well as a Menstrual History Questionnaire (MH) and the Menstrual Attitudes Questionnaire (Brooks-Gunn and Ruble 1980). The MH served as the menstruation stereotype threat. Some women were also presented with positive information about menstruation, which served as the positive prime. The order of materials varied to yield four conditions: Menstruation Threat/No Positive Prime-MH first, then cognitive tasks; Menstruation Threat/Positive Prime-MH first, then positive information, then cognitive tests; Positive Prime/No Menstruation Threat-positive information first, then cognitive tasks, then MH; and No Positive Prime/No Menstruation Threat-cognitive tests first, then MH. In all four conditions, participants completed the Menstrual Attitudes Questionnaire last. Results indicated that participants receiving the Menstruation Threat completed significantly fewer items on the Stroop test. In addition, subjects in the No Positive Prime/Menstruation Threat condition performed more poorly on the Stroop the closer they were to their next period. This effect was absent for the Positive Prime/Menstruation Threat condition and reversed for participants in the Positive Prime/No Menstruation Threat. This suggests that positive priming moderates the relationship between closeness to menstruation and cognitive performance. Implications of the results for addressing stigma associated with menstruation are discussed.},

The results indicated participants held beliefs about women\&rsquo;s superiority in this task. However, threat-activation cues did not affect production of correct words, errors, clustering, or switching in men and women. Task difficulty affected the number of correct words, yet it did not interact with the stereotype threat-activation cues. Finally, participants\&rsquo; actual performance was related to their self-rating perception about their ability instead of the stereotyping they perceived. The effect of self-efficacy, educational level, and individuals\&rsquo; susceptibilities should be taken into account when studying the effects of stereotype threat.},
