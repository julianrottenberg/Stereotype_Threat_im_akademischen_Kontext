However, the gender composition of a group may affect this ability, particularly because solo status female members (one female grouped with males) are generally allocated lower status than their male counterparts, so their knowledge is more likely to be ignored. Whereas most previous work suggests ways solo status women can increase their status; instead, we propose that groups communicate better when men give their female teammate appropriate respect. We examine this in mixed-gender groups working on a hidden profile task while wearing wireless EEGs to measure live neural activity. We find that groups who solve the problem correctly are more likely to contain majority male members with more approach-oriented mindsets, operationalized as neural alpha asymmetry, as they respect their female teammate more. Thus, we provide evidence that neural activity is partially responsible for whether mixed-gender groups make optimal decisions.","english","0 citations (Crossref) [2024-06-23]","/home/julian/Zotero/storage/TIUQLMLV/Amey et al_2023_When Majority Men Respect Minority Women, Groups Communicate Better.pdf",NA,NA,"when Majority Men Respect Minority Women, Groups Communicate Better: a Neurological Exploration.","selected",NA

Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying those often subtle and unintentional yet detrimental behaviors. Here, we assessed the neural responses to gender-based microaggressions in 28 early career faculty in medicine (               N               \,=\,16 female,               N               \,=\,12 male sex) using fMRI. Participants watched 33 videos of situations demonstrating gender-based microaggressions and control situations in academic medicine. Video topics had been previously identified through real-life anecdotes about microaggression from women faculty and were scripted and reenacted using professional actors. Primary voxel-wise analyses comparing group differences in activation elucidated a significant group by condition interaction in a right-lateralized cluster across the frontal (inferior and middle frontal gyri, frontal pole, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus) and parietal lobes (supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus). Whereas women faculty exhibited reduced activation in these regions during the microaggression relative to the control condition, the opposite was true for men. Posthoc analyses showed that these patterns were significantly associated with the degree to which participants reported feeling judged for their gender in academic medicine. Lastly, secondary exploratory ROI analyses showed significant between-group differences in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. Women activated these two regions less in the microaggression condition compared to the control condition, whereas men did not. These findings indicate that the observation of gender-based microaggressions results in a specific pattern of neural reactivity in women early career faculty.","english","1 citations (Crossref) [2024-06-23]","/home/julian/Zotero/storage/LLL4TQRH/Balters et al_2023_Neural responses to gender-based microaggressions in academic medicine.pdf",NA,NA,"Neural Responses to Gender-Based Microaggressions in Academic Medicine.","selected",NA

However, the effects of stereotype threat are largely dependent on various factors, both negative and positive. Few psychophysiological studies have studied the effects of poverty stereotype threats on inhibition ability in wealth and impoverished individuals.                                         Methods               To fill this gap in the literature, this study used the event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the brain mechanisms associated with stereotype threat in 135 participants.                                         Results               Behavioral results showed that the rich group (participants from higher-income families) had better inhibition ability than the impoverished group (participants from lower-income families), with significantly shorter reaction time and significantly greater accuracy for poverty-related stimuli when in the nonthreat condition. Additionally, poverty stereotype threat could improve performance of the impoverished group for poverty-related stimuli. The electrophysiological results showed significantly larger P3 mean amplitude and significantly longer P3 latency in the rich group than the impoverished group in the nonthreat condition. Although no significant between-group differences were found in the threat condition, the results show that the effect of poverty stereotype threat varies with different income-level persons, for both behavioral and P3 data.                                         Conclusion               These findings suggest that impoverished people have worse inhibition abilities. Further, poverty stereotype threat has different effects on people according to their income level and could help to explain irrational consumption behaviors in people.","english","3 citations (Crossref) [2024-06-23]","/home/julian/Zotero/storage/MV8LKRF7/Wang_Yang_2020_The effects of poverty stereotype threat on inhibition ability in individuals.pdf;/home/julian/Zotero/storage/S3VRS73Q/Wang_Yang_2020_The effects of poverty stereotype threat on inhibition ability in individuals.pdf","CONSUMPTION (Economics),electrophysiology,evoked potentials,EVOKED potentials (Electrophysiology),income,inhibition,POOR people,poverty,Poverty,POVERTY,STEREOTYPES,Stereotyping",NA,"The Effects of Poverty Stereotype Threat on Inhibition Ability in Individuals from Different Income-Level Families.","selected",NA

Efficient brain function does not require the function of different brain regions during specific tasks, but it does require the brain networks on which information is transported. Based on these, the effects of ST on the degree centrality under the resting state of brain regions related to these processes were investigated under math-related ST. The results showed that RSDC was decreased in the left hippocampus and left middle occipital gyrus (MOC), while RSDC was increased in the left precuneus, the right angular gyrus (AG), and the right superior parietal gyrus (SPG) under ST. Interestingly, we also found that the right-left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and the right hippocampus were negatively correlated with manipulation check (MC) score in the ST group, while the right-left ATL and the right hippocampus were positively correlated with MC score in the control group. These results might reflect those individuals who attempted to inhibit the negative emotions induced by the negative stereotypes under ST conditions while increasing the self-relevant processes by retrieving episodic memory or autobiographical memory.",NA,"0 citations (Crossref) [2024-06-23]","/home/julian/Zotero/storage/IHTZ4EVY/Wu_Zhao_2021_Degree Centrality of a Brain Network Is Altered by Stereotype Threat.pdf","Autobiographical Memory,Biological Neural Networks,Brain,brain network,Cognitive Processes,degree centrality,Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,functional network,Hippocampus,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,Negative Emotions,Parietal Lobe,rest-state fMRI,stereotype,stereotype threat,Threat",NA,"Degree Centrality of a Brain Network is Altered by Stereotype Threat: {{evidences}} from a Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.","selected",NA
