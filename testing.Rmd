# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

## Material

```{r include = TRUE, results = "asis"}

     "Hypothesis",
     "Query"
)

query_table[1, ] <- c(
     "Hypothesis 1",
